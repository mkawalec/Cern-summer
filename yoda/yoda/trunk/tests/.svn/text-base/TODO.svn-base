Requirements to be tested:

Histo1D:
 * Uniform bin booking
 * Non-uniform contiguous bin booking
 * Non-contiguous bin booking
 * Correct mean and error values
 * Correct negative weight handling
 * Handling bins with zero/negative-weights
 * +-*/ histos with exactly equal binnings

Profile1D:
 * Bookings as for Histo1D
 * Correct mean and error values - stdErr and stdDev
 * Correct negative weight handling
 * Handling bins with zero/negative-weights
 * Combining with correct stats

Number/Counter:
 * Exists!

File format:
 * Writing all data types
 * Reading and combining data types from Python

Python:
 * Interface fully functional


Later:

Histo1D:
 * +-*/ histos with compatible but not equal binnings
 * +-*/ histos with incompatible binnings
