"""observablelist.py

This module only contains one list, USE_OBS, which contains different
subsets of the DELPHI observables.
Use the list items with TuningData.buildBinDistList and
BaseMinimizer.guessMinimum to select the observables you want to use.

They are copied from Hendrik's private minimization script.
