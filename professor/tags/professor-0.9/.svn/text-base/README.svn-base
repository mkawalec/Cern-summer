The Professor package is the successor of the PROFESSOR (PROcedure For
EStimation of Systematic errORs) event generator tuning program, originally 
developed in Fortran at the University of Wuppertal to do Monte Carlo tunings 
based on data from the DELPHI LEP experiment.

Professor is being re-written and extended by a small collaboration:

Andy Buckley, IPPP, Durham University
Hendrik Hoeth, Lund University
Heiko Lacker, Humboldt University zu Berlin
Holger Schulz, Humboldt University zu Berlin
Eike von Seggern, Humboldt University zu Berlin

The new version uses the Rivet MC validation system as a base for running
generators and providing MC & reference distributions (in AIDA XML format) for
the tuning. The distributions are read by Professor and used to find the
coefficients of a parameterised interpolating distribution via a singuar value
decomposition, using SciPy. The default interpolating function is a 2nd order
polynomial in the space defined by the continuous generator parameters, and
hence parameter correlations are naturally incorporated at their leading order.
