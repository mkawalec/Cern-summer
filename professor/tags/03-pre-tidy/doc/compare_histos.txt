compare_histos.py
=================

About
-----

`compare_histos.py` is a small script which reads two or more AIDA XML files
and creates comparison plots of the histograms in the AIDA files. The plots are
saved in `.dat` files in the input format of
link:make_plot.html[`make_plot.py`]. To create PostScript or PDF file from the
`.dat` files, you need to run link:make_plot.html[`make_plot.py`].

Usage
-----

To run `compare_histos.py` call

--------------------
 compare_histos.py [options] reffile mcfile1 [mcfile2 ...]
--------------------

where `reffile` is the AIDA reference data file and the mcfiles are the AIDA
files to be compared with the reference. Possible options are:

`-o <OUTDIR>, \--outdir=<OUTDIR>`::
    Specify a directory in which the `.dat` plot files will be stored. If the
    directory does not exist, it is created.

`-l <HISTOGRAMLIST>, \--histogram-list=<HISTOGRAMLIST>`::
    Specify a file with a list of histogram names (one name per file). Only
    those histograms are plotted. Lines starting with `#` and invalid names
    are ignored. Without this option, all histograms in the AIDA files are
    used.
