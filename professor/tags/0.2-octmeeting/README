The professor Python package is the successor of the professor tuning program, 
developed for Monte Carlo tuning at the University of Wuppertal. Documentation 
is to be written ...

Professor is being extended by a small collaboration including IPPP Durham,
MPI Dresden and Hendrik Hoeth to use the Rivet MC validation system as a base
for MC tuning. More information coming soon: see the wiki pages at
http://projects.hepforge.org/professor/

Any questions: Write a mail to <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch> 
(or <andy.buckley@durham.ac.uk> for questions on the Rivet-oriented extensions)
