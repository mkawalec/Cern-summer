The Professor toolkit
=====================

Professor is a tool which creates parameterisations of very CPU expensive
functions, and uses them for tasks which require a lot of sampling -- such as
optimising input parameters or scanning a large parameter volume. The system was
developed and still is mostly used in tuning of Monte Carlo event generators for
particle physics, but the method is very generally useful.
