2011-07-18  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* bin/rivet-buildplugin.in: Pass the AM_CXXFLAGS
	variable (including the warning flags) to the C++ compiler when
	building user analysis plugins.

	* include/LWH/DataPointSet.h: Fix accidental setting of errorMinus
	= scalefactor * error_Plus_. Thanks to Anton Karneyeu for the bug
	report!

2011-07-18  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Added CMS_2011_S8884919 (charged hadron multiplicity in NSD
	events corrected to pT>=0).

	* Added CMS_2010_S8656010 and CMS_2010_S8547297 (charged
	hadron pT and eta in NSD events)

	* Added CMS_2011_S8968497 (chi_dijet)

	* Added CMS_2011_S8978280 (strangeness)

2011-07-13  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Rivet PDF manual updates, to not spread disinformation about
	bootstrapping a Genser repo.

2011-07-12  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* bin/make-plots: Protect property reading against unstripped \r
	characters from DOS newlines.

	* bin/rivet-mkhtml: Add a -M unmatch regex flag (note that these
	are matching the analysis path rather than individual histos on
	this script), and speed up the initial analysis identification and
	selection by avoiding loops of regex comparisons for repeats of
	strings which have already been analysed.

	* bin/compare-histos: remove the completely (?) unused histogram
	list, and add -m and -M regex flags, as for aida2flat and
	flat2aida.

2011-06-30  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* fix fromFlat() in lighthistos: It would ignore histogram paths
	before.

	* flat2aida: preserve histogram order from .dat files

2011-06-27  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* pyext/setup.py.in: Use CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS safely in the Python
	extension build, and improve the use of build/src directory
	arguments.

2011-06-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding a tentative rivet-updateanalyses script, based on
	lhapdf-getdata, which will download new analyses as requested. We
	could change our analysis-providing behaviour a bit to allow this
	sort of delivery mechanism to be used as the normal way of getting
	analysis updates without us having to make a whole new Rivet
	release. It is nice to be able to identify analyses with releases,
	though, for tracking whether bugs have been addressed.

2011-06-10  Frank Siegert  <frank.siegert@cern.ch>

	* Bugfixes in WFinder.

2011-06-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding \physicsxcoor and \physicsycoor treatment to make-plots.

2011-06-06  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Allow for negative cross-sections. NLO tools need this.

	* make-plots: For RatioPlotMode=deviation also consider the MC
	uncertainties, not just data.

2011-06-04  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Add support for goodness-of-fit calculations to make-plots.
	The results are shown in the legend, and one histogram can
	be selected to determine the color of the plot margin. See
	the documentation for more details.

2011-06-04  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding auto conversion of Histogram2D to DataPointSets in the
	AnalysisHandler _normalizeTree method.

2011-06-03  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding a file-weight feature to the Run object, which will
	optionally rescale the weights in the provided HepMC files. This
	should be useful for e.g. running on multiple differently-weighted
	AlpGen HepMC files/streams. The new functionality is used by the
	rivet command via an optional weight appended to the filename with
	a colon delimiter, e.g. "rivet fifo1.hepmc fifo2.hepmc:2.31"

2011-06-01  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Add BeamThrust projection

2011-05-31  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fix LIBS for fastjet-3.0

	* Add basic infrastructure for Taylor plots in make-plots

	* Fix OPAL_2004_S6132243: They are using charged+neutral.

	* Release 1.5.1

2011-05-22  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding plots of stable and decayed PID multiplicities to
	MC_GENERIC (useful for sanity-checking generator setups).

	* Removing actually-unused ProjectionApplier.fhh forward
	declaration header.

2011-05-20  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removing import of ipython shell from rivet-rescale, having just
	seen it throw a multi-coloured warning message on a student's
	lxplus Rivet session!

	* Adding support for the compare-histos --no-ratio flag when using
	rivet-mkhtml. Adding --rel-ratio, --linear, etc. is an exercise
	for the enthusiast ;-)

2011-05-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Internal minor changes to the ProjectionHandler and
	ProjectionApplier interfaces, in particular changing the
	ProjectionHandler::create() function to be called getInstance and
	to return a reference rather than a pointer. The reference change
	is to make way for an improved singleton implementation, which
	cannot yet be used due to a bug in projection memory
	management. The code of the improved singleton is available, but
	commented out, in ProjectionManager.hh to allow for easier
	migration and to avoid branching.

2011-05-08  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Extending flat2aida to be able to read from and write to
	stdin/out as for aida2flat, and also eliminating the internal
	histo parsing representation in favour of the one in
	lighthisto. lighthisto's fromFlat also needed a bit of an
	overhaul: it has been extended to parse each histo's chunk of
	text (including BEGIN and END lines) in fromFlatHisto, and for
	fromFlat to parse a collection of histos from a file, in keeping
	with the behaviour of fromDPS/fromAIDA. Merging into Professor is
	now needed.

	* Extending aida2flat to have a better usage message, to accept
	input from stdin for command chaining via pipes, and to be a bit
	more sensibly internally structured (although it also now has to
	hold all histos in memory before writing out -- that shouldn't be
	a problem for anything other than truly huge histo files).

2011-05-04  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* compare-histos: If using --mc-errs style, prefer dotted and
	dashdotted line styles to dashed, since dashes are often too long
	to be distinguishable from solid lines. Even better might be to
	always use a solid line for MC errs style, and to add more colours.

	* rivet-mkhtml: use a no-mc-errors drawing style by default,
	to match the behaviour of compare-histos, which it calls. The
	--no-mc-errs option has been replaced with an --mc-errs option.

2011-05-04  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Ignore duplicate files in compare-histos.

2011-04-25  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding some hadron-specific N and sumET vs. |eta| plots to MC_GENERIC.

	* Re-adding an explicit attempt to get the beam particles, since
	HepMC's IO_HERWIG seems to not always set them even though it's
	meant to.

2011-04-19  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Added ATLAS_2011_S9002537 W asymmetry analysis

2011-04-14  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* deltaR, deltaPhi, deltaEta now available in all combinations of
	FourVector, FourMomentum, Vector3, doubles. They also accept jets
	and particles as arguments now.

2011-04-13  David Grellscheid <david.grellscheid@durham.ac.uk>

	* added ATLAS 8983313: 0-lepton BSM

2011-04-01  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* bin/rivet-mkanalysis: Don't try to download SPIRES or HepData
	info if it's not a standard analysis (i.e. if the SPIRES ID is not
	known), and make the default .info file validly parseable by YAML,
	which was an unfortunate gotcha for anyone writing a first
	analysis.

2011-03-31  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* bin/compare-histos: Write more appropriate ratio plot labels
	when not comparing to data, and use the default make-plots labels
	when comparing to data.

	* bin/rivet-mkhtml: Adding a timestamp to the generated pages, and
	a -t/--title option to allow setting the main HTML page title on
	the command line: otherwise it becomes impossible to tell these
	pages apart when you have a lot of them, except by URL!

2011-03-24  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* bin/aida2flat: Adding a -M option to *exclude* histograms whose
	paths match a regex. Writing a negative lookahead regex with
	positive matching was far too awkward!

2011-03-18  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* src/Core/AnalysisHandler.cc (AnalysisHandler::removeAnalysis):
	Fixed strange shared pointer assignment that caused seg-fault.

2011-03-13  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* filling of functions works now in a more intuitive way (I hope).

2011-03-09  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Version 1.5.0 release!

2011-03-08  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding some extra checks for external packages in make-plots.

2011-03-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Changing the accuracy of the beam energy checking to 1%, to make
	the UI a bit more forgiving. It's still best to specify exactly the right
	energy of course!

2011-03-01  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding --no-plottitle to compare-histos (+ completion).

	* Fixing segfaults in UA1_1990_S2044935 and UA5_1982_S875503.

	* Bump ABI version numbers for 1.5.0 release.

	* Use AnalysisInfo for storage of the NeedsCrossSection analysis flag.

	* Allow field setting in AnalysisInfo.

2011-02-27  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Support LineStyle=dashdotted in make-plots

	* New command line option --style for compare-histos. Options are
	"default", "bw" and "talk".

	* cleaner uninstall

2011-02-26  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Changing internal storage and return type of Particle::pdgId()
	to PdgId, and adding Particle::energy().

	* Renaming Analysis::energies() as Analysis::requiredEnergies().

	* Adding beam energies into beam consistency checking:
	Analysis::isCompatible methods now also require the beam energies
	to be provided.

	* Removing long-deprecated AnalysisHandler::init() constructor and
	AnalysisHandler::removeIncompatibleAnalyses() methods.

2011-02-25  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding --disable-obsolete, which takes its value from the value
	of --disable-preliminary by default.

	* Replacing RivetUnvalidated and RivetPreliminary plugin libraries
	with optionally-configured analysis contents in the
	experiment-specific plugin libraries. This avoids issues with
	making libraries rebuild consistently when sources were reassigned
	between libraries.

2011-02-24  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Changing analysis plugin registration to fall back through
	available paths rather than have RIVET_ANALYSIS_PATH totally
	override the built-in paths. The first analysis hook of a given
	name to be found is now the one that's used: any duplicates found
	will be warned about but unused. getAnalysisLibPaths() now returns
	*all* the search paths, in keeping with the new search behaviour.

2011-02-22  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Moving the definition of the MSG_* macros into the Logging.hh
	header. They can't be used everywhere, though, as they depend on
	the existence of a this->getLog() method in the call scope. This
	move makes them available in e.g. AnalysisHandler and other bits
	of framework other than projections and analyses.

	* Adding a gentle print-out from the Rivet AnalysisHandler if
	preliminary analyses are being used, and strengthening the current
	warning if unvalidated analyses are used.

	* Adding documentation about the validation "process" and
	the (un)validated and preliminary analysis statuses.

	* Adding the new RivetPreliminary analysis library, and the
	corresponding --disable-preliminary configure flag. Analyses in
	this library are subject to change names, histograms, reference
	data values, etc. between releases: make sure you check any
	dependences on these analyses when upgrading Rivet.

	* Change the Python script ref data search behaviours to use Rivet
	ref data by default where available, rather than requiring a -R
	option. Where relevant, -R is still a valid option, to avoid
	breaking legacy scripts, and there is a new --no-rivet-refs option
	to turn the default searching *off*.

	* Add the prepending and appending optional arguments to the path
	searching functions. This will make it easier to combine the
	search functions with user-supplied paths in Python scripts.

	* Make make-plots killable!

	* Adding Rivet version to top of run printout.

	* Adding Run::crossSection() and printing out the cross-section in
	pb at the end of a Rivet run.

2011-02-22  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Make lighthisto.py aware of 2D histograms

	* Adding published versions of the CDF_2008 leading jets and DY
	analyses, and marking the preliminary ones as "OBSOLETE".

2011-02-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding PDF documentation for path searching and .info/.plot
	files, and tidying overfull lines.

	* Removing unneeded const declarations from various return by
	value path and internal binning functions. Should not affect ABI
	compatibility but will force recompilation of external packages
	using the RivetPaths.hh and Utils.hh headers.

	* Adding findAnalysis*File(fname) functions, to be used by Rivet
	scripts and external programs to find files known to Rivet
	according to Rivet's (newly standard) lookup rule.

	* Changing search path function behaviour to always return *all*
	search directories rather than overriding the built-in locations
	if the environment variables are set.

2011-02-20  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding the ATLAS 2011 transverse jet shapes analysis.

2011-02-18  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Support for transparency in make-plots

2011-02-18  Frank Siegert <frank.siegert@cern.ch>

	* Added ATLAS prompt photon analysis ATLAS_2010_S8914702

2011-02-10  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Simple NOOP constructor for Thrust projection

	* Add CMS event shape analysis. Data read off the plots. We
	will get the final numbers when the paper is accepted by
	the journal.

2011-02-10  Frank Siegert <frank.siegert@cern.ch>

	* Add final version of ATLAS dijet azimuthal decorrelation

2011-02-10  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* remove ATLAS conf note analyses for which we have final data
	* reshuffle histograms in ATLAS minbias analysis to match Hepdata
	* small pT-cut fix in ATLAS track based UE analysis

2011-01-31  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Doc tweaks and adding cmp-by-|p| functions for Jets, to match
	those added by Hendrik for Particles.

	* Don't sum photons around muons in the D0 2010 Z pT analysis.

2011-01-27  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding ATLAS 2010 min bias and underlying event analyses and data.

2011-01-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Make make-plots write out PDF rather than PS by default.

2011-01-12  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fix several rendering and comparison bugs in rivet-mkhtml.

	* Allow make-plots to write into an existing directory, at the
	user's own risk.

	* Make rivet-mkhtml produce PDF-based output rather than PS by
	default (most people want PDF these days). Can we do the same
	change of default for make-plots?

	* Add getAnalysisPlotPaths() function, and use it in compare-histos

	* Use proper .info file search path function internally in AnalysisInfo::make.

2011-01-11  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Clean up ATLAS dijet analysis.

2010-12-30  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding a run timeout option, and small bug-fixes to the event
	timeout handling, and making first event timeout work nicely with
	the run timeout. Run timeout is intended to be used in conjunction
	with timed batch token expiry, of the type that likes to make 0
	byte AIDA files on LCG when Grid proxies time out.

2010-12-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fix the cuts in the CDF 1994 colour coherence analysis.

2010-12-19  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixing CDF midpoint cone jet algorithm default construction to
	have an overlap threshold of 0.5 rather than 0.75. This was
	recommended by the FastJet manual, and noticed while adding the
	ATLAS and CMS cones.

	* Adding ATLAS and CMS old iterative cones as "official" FastJets
	constructor options (they could always have been used by explicit
	instantiation and attachment of a Fastjet plugin object).

	* Removing defunct and unused ClosestJetShape projection.

2010-12-16  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* bin/compare-histos, pyext/lighthisto.py: Take ref paths from
	rivet module API rather than getting the environment by hand.

	* pyext/lighthisto.py: Only read .plot info from the first
	matching file (speed-up compare-histos).

2010-12-14  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Augmenting the physics vector functionality to make FourMomentum
	support maths operators with the correct return type (FourMomentum
	rather than FourVector).

2010-12-11  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding a --event-timeout option to control the event timeout,
	adding it to the completion script, and making sure that the init
	time check is turned OFF once successful!

	* Adding an 3600 second timeout for initialising an event file. If
	it takes longer than (or anywhere close to) this long, chances are
	that the event source is inactive for some reason (perhaps
	accidentally unspecified and stdin is not active, or the event
	generator has died at the other end of the pipe. The reason for
	not making it something shorter is that e.g. Herwig++ or Sherpa
	can have long initialisation times to set up the MPI handler or to
	run the matrix element integration. An timeout after an hour is
	still better than a batch job which runs for two days before you
	realise that you forgot to generate any events!

2010-12-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixing unbooked-histo segfault in UA1_1990_S2044935 at 63 GeV.

2010-12-08  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fixes in ATLAS_2010_CONF_083, declaring it validated

	* Added ATLAS_2010_CONF_046, only two plots are implemented.
	The paper will be out soon, and we don't need the other plots
	right now. Data is read off the plots in the note.

	* New option "SmoothLine" for HISTOGRAM sections in make-plots

	* Changed CustomTicks to CustomMajorTicks and added CustomMinorTicks
	in make-plots.

2010-12-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Update the documentation to explain this latest bump to path
	lookup behaviours.

	* Various improvements to existing path lookups. In particular,
	the analysis lib path locations are added to the info and ref
	paths to avoid having to set three variables when you have all
	three file types in the same personal plugin directory.

	* Adding setAnalysisLibPaths and addAnalysisLibPath
	functions. rivet --analysis-path{,-append} now use these and work
	correctly. Hurrah!

	* Add --show-analyses as an alias for --show-analysis, following a
	comment at the ATLAS tutorial.

2010-12-07  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Change LegendXPos behaviour in make-plots. Now the top left
	corner of the legend is used as anchor point.

2010-12-03  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* 1.4.0 release.

	* Add bin-skipping to compare-histos to avoid one use of
	rivet-rmgaps (it's still needed for non-plotting post-processing
	like Professor).

2010-12-03  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fix normalisation issues in UA5 and ALEPH analyses

2010-11-27  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* MathUtils.hh: Adding fuzzyGtrEquals and fuzzyLessEquals, and
	tidying up the math utils collection a bit.

	* CDF 1994 colour coherence analysis overhauled and
	correction/norm factors fixed. Moved to VALIDATED status.

	* Adding programmable completion for aida2flat and flat2aida.

	* Improvements to programmable completion using the neat _filedir
	completion shell function which I just discovered.

2010-11-26  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Tweak to floating point inRange to use fuzzyEquals for CLOSED
	interval equality comparisons.

	* Some BibTeX generation improvements, and fixing the ATLAS dijet
	BibTeX key.

	* Resolution upgrade in PNG make-plots output.

	* CDF_2005_S6217184.cc, CDF_2008_S7782535.cc: Updates to use the
	new per-jet JetAlg interface (and some other fixes).

	* JetAlg.cc: Changed the interface on request to return per-jet
	rather than per-event jet shapes, with an extra jet index argument.

	* MathUtils.hh: Adding index_between(...) function, which is handy
	for working out which bin a value falls in, given a set of bin edges.

2010-11-25  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Cmp.hh: Adding ASC/DESC (and ANTISORTED) as preferred
	non-EQUIVALENT enum value synonyms over misleading
	SORTED/UNSORTED.

	* Change of rapidity scheme enum name to RapScheme

	* Reworking JetShape a bit further: constructor args now avoid
	inconsistencies (it was previously possible to define incompatible
	range-ends and interval). Internal binning implementation also
	reworked to use a vector of bin edges: the bin details are
	available via the interface. The general jet pT cuts can be
	applied via the JetShape constructor.

	* MathUtils.hh: Adding linspace and logspace utility
	functions. Useful for defining binnings.

	* Adding more general cuts on jet pT and (pseudo)rapidity.

2010-11-11  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding special handling of FourMomentum::mass() for computed
	zero-mass vectors for which mass2 can go (very slightly) negative
	due to numerical precision.

2010-11-10  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Adding ATLAS-CONF-2010-083 conference note. Data is read from plots.
	When I run Pythia 6 the bins close to pi/2 are higher than in the note,
	so I call this "unvalidated". But then ... the note doesn't specify
	a tune or even just a version for the generators in the plots. Not even
	if they used Pythia 6 or Pythia 8. Probably 6, since they mention AGILe.

2010-11-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding a JetAlg::useInvisibles(bool) mechanism to allow ATLAS
	jet studies to include neutrinos. Anyone who chooses to use this
	mechanism had better be careful to remove hard neutrinos manually
	in the provided FinalState object.

2010-11-09  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Adding ATLAS-CONF-2010-049 conference note. Data is read from plots.
	Fragmentation functions look good, but I can't reproduce the MC lines
	(or even the relative differences between them) in the jet cross-section
	plots. So consider those unvalidated for now. Oh, and it seems ATLAS
	screwed up the error bands in their ratio plots, too. They are
	upside-down.

2010-11-07  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Adding ATLAS-CONF-2010-081 conference note. Data is read from plots.

2010-11-06  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Deprecating the old JetShape projection and renaming to
	ClosestJetShape: the algorithm has a tenuous relationship with
	that actually used in the CDF (and ATLAS) jet shape analyses. CDF
	analyses to be migrated to the new JetShape projection... and some
	of that projection's features, design elements, etc. to be
	finished off: we may as well take this opportunity to clear up
	what was one of our nastiest pieces of code.

2010-11-05  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Adding ATLAS-CONF-2010-031 conference note. Data is read from plots.

2010-10-29  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Making rivet-buildplugin use the same C++ compiler and CXXFLAGS
	variable as used for the Rivet system build.

	* Fixing NeutralFinalState projection to, erm, actually select
	neutral particles (by Hendrik).

	* Allow passing a general FinalState reference to the JetShape
	projection, rather than requiring a VetoedFS.

2010-10-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding a --with-root flag to rivet-buildplugin to add
	root-config --libs flags to the plugin build command.

2010-09-24  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Releasing as Rivet 1.3.0.

	* Bundling underscore.sty to fix problems with running make-plots
	on dat files generated by compare-histos from AIDA files with
	underscores in their names.

2010-09-16  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fix error in N_effective definition for weighted profile errors.

2010-08-18  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding MC_GENERIC analysis. NB. Frank Siegert also added MC_HJETS.

2010-08-03  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixing compare-histos treatment of what is now a ref file, and
	speeding things up... again. What a mess!

2010-08-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding rivet-nopy: a super-simple Rivet C++ command line
	interface which avoids Python to make profiling and debugging
	easier.

	* Adding graceful exception handling to the AnalysisHandler event
	loop methods.

	* Changing compare-histos behaviour to always show plots for which
	there is at least one MC histo. The default behaviour should now
	be the correct one in 99% of use cases.

2010-07-30  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Merging in a fix for shared_ptrs not being compared for
	insertion into a set based on raw pointer value.

2010-07-16  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding an explicit library dependency declaration on libHepMC,
	and hence removing the -lHepMC from the rivet-config --libs
	output.

2010-07-14  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding a manual section on use of Rivet (and AGILe) as
	libraries, and how to use the -config scripts to aid compilation.

	* FastJets projection now allows setting of a jet area definition,
	plus a hacky mapping for getting the area-enabled cluster
	sequence. Requested by Pavel Starovoitov & Paolo Francavilla.

	* Lots of script updates in last two weeks!

2010-06-30  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Minimising amount of Log class mapped into SWIG.

	* Making Python ext build checks fail with error rather than
	warning if it has been requested (or, rather, not explicitly
	disabled).

2010-06-28  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Converting rivet Python module to be a package, with the dlopen
	flag setting etc. done around the SWIG generated core wrapper
	module (rivet.rivetwrap).

	* Requiring Python >= 2.4.0 in rivet scripts (and adding a Python
	version checker function to rivet module)

	* Adding --epspng option to make-plots (and converting to use subprocess.Popen).

2010-06-27  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Converting JADE_OPAL analysis to use the fastjet
	exclusive_ymerge_*max* function, rather than just
	exclusive_ymerge: everything looks good now. It seems that fastjet
	>= 2.4.2 is needed for this to work properly.

2010-06-24  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Making rivet-buildplugin look in its own bin directory when
	trying to find rivet-config.

2010-06-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding protection and warning about numerical precision issues
	in jet mass calculation/histogramming to the MC_JetAnalysis
	analysis.

	* Numerical precision improvement in calculation of
	Vector4::mass2.

	* Adding relative scale ratio plot flag to compare-histos

	* Extended command completion to rivet-config, compare-histos, and
	make-plots.

	* Providing protected log messaging macros,
	MSG_{TRACE,DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR} cf. Athena.

	* Adding environment-aware functions for Rivet search path list access.

2010-06-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Using .info file beam ID and energy info in HTML and LaTeX documentation.

	* Using .info file beam ID and energy info in command-line printout.

	* Fixing a couple of references to temporary variables in the
	analysis beam info, which had been introduced during refactoring:
	have reinstated reference-type returns as the more efficient
	solution. This should not affect API compatibility.

	* Making SWIG configure-time check include testing for
	incompatibilities with the C++ compiler (re. the recurring _const_
	char* literals issue).

	* Various tweaks to scripts: make-plots and compare-histos
	processes are now renamed (on Linux), rivet-config is avoided when
	computing the Rivet version,and RIVET_REF_PATH is also set using
	the rivet --analysis-path* flags. compare-histos now uses multiple
	ref data paths for .aida file globbing.

	* Hendrik changed VetoedFinalState comparison to always return
	UNDEFINED if vetoing on the results of other FS projections is
	being used. This is the only simple way to avoid problems
	emanating from the remainingFinalState thing.

2010-06-19  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding --analysis-path and --analysis-path-append command-line
	flags to the rivet script, as a "persistent" way to set or extend
	the RIVET_ANALYSIS_PATH variable.

	* Changing -Q/-V script verbosity arguments to more standard
	-q/-v, after Hendrik moaned about it ;)

	* Small fix to TinyXML operator precendence: removes a warning,
	and I think fixes a small bug.

	* Adding plotinfo entries for new jet rapidity and jet mass plots
	in MC_JetAnalysis derivatives.

	* Moving MC_JetAnalysis base class into a new
	libRivetAnalysisTools library, with analysis base class and helper
	headers to be stored in the reinstated Rivet/Analyses include
	directory.

2010-06-08  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removing check for CEDARSTD #define guard, since we no longer
	compile against AGILe and don't have to be careful about
	duplication.

	* Moving crappy closest approach and decay significance functions
	from Utils into SVertex, which is the only place they have ever
	been used (and is itself almost entirely pointless).

	* Overhauling particle ID <-> name system to clear up ambiguities
	between enums, ints, particles and beams. There are no more enums,
	although the names are still available as const static ints, and
	names are now obtained via a singleton class which wraps an STL
	map for name/ID lookups in both directions.

2010-05-18  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fixing factor-of-2 bug in the error calculation when scaling
	histograms.

	* Fixing D0_2001_S4674421 analysis.

2010-05-11  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Replacing TotalVisibleMomentum with MissingMomentum in analyses
	and WFinder. Using vector ET rather than scalar ET in some places.

2010-05-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Revamping the AnalysisHandler constructor and data writing, with
	some LWH/AIDA mangling to bypass the stupid AIDA idea of having to
	specify the sole output file and format when making the data
	tree. Preferred AnalysisHandler constructor now takes only one arg
	-- the runname -- and there is a new AH.writeData(outfile) method
	to replace AH.commitData(). Doing this now to begin migration to
	more flexible histogramming in the long term.

2010-04-21  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fixing LaTeX problems (make-plots) on ancient machines, like lxplus.

2010-04-29  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixing (I hope!) the treatment of weighted profile bin errors in LWH.

2010-04-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removing defunct and unused KtJets and Configuration classes.

	* Hiding some internal details from Doxygen.

	* Add @brief Doxygen comments to all analyses, projections and
	core classes which were missing them.

2010-04-21  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* remove obsolete reference to InitialQuarks from DELPHI_2002
	* fix normalisation in CDF_2000_S4155203

2010-04-20  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* bin/make-plots: real support for 2-dim histograms plotted as
	colormaps, updated the documentation accordingly.
	* fix misleading help comment in configure.ac

2010-04-08  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* bin/root2flat: Adding this little helper script, minimally
	modified from one which Holger Schulz made for internal use in
	ATLAS.

2010-04-05  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Using spiresbib in rivet-mkanalysis: analysis templates made
	with rivet-mkanalysis will now contain a SPIRES-dumped BibTeX key
	and entry if possible!

	* Adding BibKey and BibTeX entries to analysis metadata files, and
	updating doc build to use them rather than the time-consuming
	SPIRES screen-scraping. Added SPIRES BibTeX dumps to all analysis
	metadata using new (uninstalled & unpackaged) doc/get-spires-data
	script hack.

	* Updating metadata files to add Energies, Beams and PtCuts
	entries to all of them.

	* Adding ToDo, NeedsCrossSection, and better treatment of Beams
	and Energies entries in metadata files and in AnalysisInfo and
	Analysis interfaces.

2010-04-03  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Frank Siegert: Update of rivet-mkhtml to conform to improved
	compare-histos.

	* Frank Siegert: LWH output in precision-8 scientific notation, to
	solve a binning precision problem... the first time weve noticed a
	problem!

	* Improved treatment of data/reference datasets and labels in
	compare-histos.

	* Rewrite of rivet-mkanalysis in Python to make way for neat
	additions.

	* Improving SWIG tests, since once again the user's biuld system
	must include SWIG (no test to check that it's a 'good SWIG', since
	the meaning of that depends on which compiler is being used and we
	hope that the user system is consistent... evidence from Finkified
	Macs and bloody SLC5 notwithstanding).

2010-03-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Tag as patch release 1.2.1.

2010-03-22  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* General tidying of return arguments and intentionally unused
	parameters to keep -Wextra happy (some complaints remain from
	TinyXML, FastJet, and HepMC).

	* Some extra bug fixes: in FastJets projection with explicit
	plugin argument, removing muon veto cut on FoxWolframMoments.

	* Adding UNUSED macro to help with places where compiler warnings
	can't be helped.

	* Turning on -Wextra warnings, and fixing some violations.

2010-03-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding MissingMomentum projection, as replacement for ~all uses
	of now-deprecated TotalVisibleMomentum projection.

	* Fixing bug with TotalVisibleMomentum projection usage in MC_SUSY
	analysis.

	* Frank Siegert fixed major bug in pTmin param passing to FastJets
	projection. D'oh: requires patch release.

2010-03-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Tagging for 1.2.0 release... at last!

2010-03-01  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Updates to manual, manual generation scripts, analysis info etc.

	* Add HepData URL to metadata print-out with rivet --show-analysis

	* Fix average Et plot in UA1 analysis to only apply to the tracker
	acceptance (but to include neutral particle contributions,
	i.e. the region of the calorimeter in the tracker acceptance).

	* Use Et rather than pT in filling the scalar Et measure in
	TotalVisibleMomentum.

	* Fixes to UA1 normalisation (which is rather funny in the paper).

2010-02-26  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Update WFinder to not place cuts and other restrictions on the
	neutrino.

2010-02-11  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Change analysis loader behaviour to use ONLY RIVET_ANALYSIS_PATH
	locations if set, otherwise use ONLY the standard Rivet analysis
	install path. Should only impact users of personal plugin
	analyses, who should now explicitly set RIVET_ANALYSIS_PATH to
	load their analysis... and who can now create personal versions of
	standard analyses without getting an error message about duplicate
	loading.

2010-01-15  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Add tests for "stable" heavy flavour hadrons in jets (rather
	than just testing for c/b hadrons in the ancestor lists of stable
	jet constituents)

2009-12-23  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* New option "RatioPlotMode=deviation" in make-plots.

2009-12-14  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* New option "MainPlot" in make-plots. For people who only want
	the ratio plot and nothing else.

	* New option "ConnectGaps" in make-plots. Set to 1 if you
	want to connect gaps in histograms with a line when ErrorBars=0.
	Works both in PLOT and in HISTOGRAM sections.

	* Eliminated global variables for coordinates in make-plots and
	enabled multithreading.

2009-12-14  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* AnalysisHandler::execute now calls AnalysisHandler::init(event)
	if it has not yet been initialised.

	* Adding more beam configuration features to Beam and
	AnalysisHandler: the setRunBeams(...) methods on the latter now
	allows a beam configuration for the run to be specified without
	using the Run class.

2009-12-11  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removing use of PVertex from few remaining analyses. Still used
	by SVertex, which is itself hardly used and could maybe be
	removed...

2009-12-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Updating JADE_OPAL to do the histo booking in init(), since
	sqrtS() is now available at that stage.

	* Renaming and slightly re-engineering all MC_*_* analyses to not
	be collider-specific (now the Analysis::sqrtS/beams()) methods
	mean that histograms can be dynamically binned.

	* Creating RivetUnvalidated.so plugin library for unvalidated
	analyses. Unvalidated analyses now need to be explicitly enabled
	with a --enable-unvalidated flag on the configure script.

	* Various min bias analyses updated and validated.

2009-12-10  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Propagate SPECIAL and HISTOGRAM sections from .plot files
	through compare-histos

	* STAR_2006_S6860818: <pT> vs particle mass, validate analysis

2009-12-04  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Use scaling rather than normalising in DELPHI_1996: this is
	generally desirable, since normalizing to 1 for 1/sig dsig/dx
	observables isn't correct if any events fall outside the histo
	bounds.

	* Many fixes to OPAL_2004.

	* Improved Hemispheres interface to remove unnecessary consts on
	returned doubles, and to also return non-squared versions
	of (scaled) hemisphere masses.

	* Add "make pyclean" make target at the top level to make it
	easier for developers to clean their Python module build when the
	API is extended.

	* Identify use of unvalidated analyses with a warning message at
	runtime.

	* Providing Analysis::sqrtS() and Analysis::beams(), and making
	sure they're available by the time the init methods are called.

2009-12-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding passing of first event sqrt(s) and beams to analysis handler.

	* Restructuring running to only use one HepMC input file (no-one
	was using multiple ones, right?) and to break down the Run class
	to cleanly separate the init and event loop phases. End of file is
	now neater.

2009-12-01  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding parsing of beam types and pairs of energies from YAML.

2009-12-01  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fixing trigger efficiency in CDF_2009_S8233977

2009-11-30  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Using shared pointers to make I/O object memory management
	neater and less error-prone.

	* Adding crossSectionPerEvent() method [==
	crossSection()/sumOfWeights()] to Analysis. Useful for histogram
	scaling since numerator of sumW_passed/sumW_total (to calculate
	pass-cuts xsec) is cancelled by dividing histo by sumW_passed.

	* Clean-up of Particle class and provision of inline PID::
	functions which take a Particle as an argument to avoid having to
	explicitly call the Particle::pdgId() method.

2009-11-30  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fixing division by zero in Profile1D bin errors for
	bins with just a single entry.

2009-11-24  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* First working version of STAR_2006_S6860818

2009-11-23  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Adding missing CDF_2001_S4751469 plots to uemerge
	* New "ShowZero" option in make-plots
	* Improving lots of plot defaults
	* Fixing typos / non-existing bins in CDF_2001_S4751469 and
	CDF_2004_S5839831 reference data

2009-11-19  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fixing our compare() for doubles.

2009-11-17  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Zeroth version of STAR_2006_S6860818 analysis (identified
	strange particles). Not working yet for unstable particles.

2009-11-11  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding separate jet-oriented and photon-oriented observables to
	MC PHOTONJETUE analysis.

	* Bug fix in MC leading jets analysis, and general tidying of
	leading jet analyses to insert units, etc. (should not affect any
	current results)

2009-11-10  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fixing last issues in STAR_2006_S6500200 and setting it to
	VALIDATED.
	* Noramlise STAR_2006_S6870392 to cross-section

2009-11-09  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Overhaul of jet caching and ParticleBase interface.

	* Adding lists of analyses' histograms (obtained by scanning the
	plot info files) to the LaTeX documentation.

2009-11-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding checking system to ensure that Projections aren't
	registered before the init phase of analyses.

	* Now that the ProjHandler isn't full of defunct pointers (which
	tend to coincidentally point to *new* Projection pointers rather
	than undefined memory, hence it wasn't noticed until recently!),
	use of a duplicate projection name is now banned with a helpful
	message at runtime.

	* (Huge) overhaul of ProjectionHandler system to use shared_ptr:
	projections are now deleted much more efficiently, naturally
	cleaning themselves out of the central repository as they go out
	of scope.

2009-11-06  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding Cmp<double> specialisation, using fuzzyEquals().

2009-11-05  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fixing histogram division code.

2009-11-04  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* New analysis STAR_2006_S6500200 (pion and proton pT spectra in
	pp collisions at 200 GeV). It is still unclear if they used a cut
	in rapidity or pseudorapidity, thus the analysis is declared
	"UNDER DEVELOPMENT" and "DO NOT USE".
	* Fixing compare() in NeutralFinalState and MergedFinalState

2009-11-04  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding consistence checking on beam ID and sqrt(s) vs. those
	from first event.

2009-11-03  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding more assertion checks to linear algebra testing.

2009-11-02  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fixing normalisation issue with stacked histograms in
	make-plots.

2009-10-30  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* CDF_2009_S8233977: Updating data and axes labels to match final
	paper. Normalise to cross-section instead of data.

2009-10-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixing Cheese-3 plot in CDF 2004... at last!

2009-10-23  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fix muon veto in CDF_1994_S2952106, CDF_2005_S6217184,
	CDF_2008_S7782535, and D0_2004_S5992206

2009-10-19  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding analysis info files for MC SUSY and PHOTONJETUE analyses.

	* Adding MC UE analysis in photon+jet events.

2009-10-19  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Adding new NeutralFinalState projection. Note that this final
	state takes E_T instead of p_T as argument (makes more sense for
	neutral particles). The compare() method does not yet work as
	expected (E_T comparison still missing).

	* Adding new MergedFinalState projection. This merges two final
	states, removing duplicate particles. Duplicates are identified by
	looking at the genParticle(), so users need to take care of any
	manually added particles themselves.

	* Fixing most open issues with the STAR_2009_UE_HELEN analysis.
	There is only one question left, regarding the away region.

	* Set the default split-merge value for SISCone in our FastJets
	projection to the recommended (but not Fastjet-default!) value of
	0.75.

2009-10-17  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding parsing of units in cross-sections passed to the "-x"
	flag, i.e. "-x 101 mb" is parsed internally into 1.01e11 pb.

2009-10-16  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Disabling DELPHI_2003_WUD_03_11 in the Makefiles, since I don't
	trust the data.

	* Getting STAR_2009_UE_HELEN to work.

2009-10-04  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding triggers and other tidying to (still unvalidated)
	UA1_1990 analysis.

	* Fixing definition of UA5 trigger to not be intrinscally
	different for pp and ppbar: this is corrected for (although it
	takes some readng to work this out) in the 1982 paper, which I
	think is the only one to compare the two modes.

	* Moving projection setup and registration into init() method for
	remaining analyses.

	* Adding trigger implementations as projections for CDF Runs 0 &
	1, and for UA5.

2009-10-01  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Moving projection setup and registration into init() method for
	analyses from ALEPH, CDF and the MC_ group.

	* Adding generic SUSY validation analysis, based on plots used in
	ATLAS Herwig++ validation.

	* Adding sorted particle accessors to FinalState (cf. JetAlg).

2009-09-29  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding optional use of args as regex match expressions with
	-l/--list-analyses.

2009-09-03  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Passing GSL include path to compiler, since its absence was
	breaking builds on systems with no GSL installation in a standard
	location (such as SLC5, for some mysterious reason!)

	* Removing lib extension passing to compiler from the configure
	script, because Macs and Linux now both use .so extensions for the
	plugin analysis modules.

2009-09-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding analysis info file path search with RIVET_DATA_PATH
	variable (and using this to fix doc build.)

	* Improvements to AnalysisLoader path search.

	* Moving analysis sources back into single directory, after a
	proletarian uprising ;)

2009-09-01  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding WFinder and WAnalysis, based on Z proj and analysis, with
	some tidying of the Z code.

	* ClusteredPhotons now uses an IdentifiedFS to pick the photons to
	be looped over, and only clusters photons around *charged* signal
	particles.

2009-08-31  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Splitting analyses by directory, to make it easier to disable
	building of particular analysis group plugin libs.

	* Removing/merging headers for all analyses except for the special
	MC_JetAnalysis base class.

	* Exit with an error message if addProjection is used twice from
	the same parent with distinct projections.

2009-08-28  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Changed naming convention for analysis plugin libraries, since
	the loader has changed so much: they must now *start* with the
	word "Rivet" (i.e. no lib prefix).

	* Split standard plugin analyses into several plugin libraries:
	these will eventually move into separate subdirs for extra build
	convenience.

	* Started merging analysis headers into the source files, now that
	we can (the plugin hooks previously forbade this).

	* Replacement of analysis loader system with a new one based on
	ideas from ThePEG, which uses dlopen-time instantiation of
	templated global variables to reduce boilerplate plugin hooks to
	one line in analyses.

2009-07-14  Frank Siegert  <frank.siegert@durham.ac.uk>

	* Replacing in-source histo-booking metadata with .plot files.

2009-07-14  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Making Python wrapper files copy into place based on bundled
	versions for each active HepMC interface (2.3, 2.4 & 2.5), using a
	new HepMC version detector test in configure.

	* Adding YAML metadata files and parser, removing same metadata
	from the analysis classes' source headers.

2009-07-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding Jet::hadronicEnergy()

	* Adding VisibleFinalState and automatically using it in JetAlg
	projections.

	* Adding YAML parser for new metadata (and eventually ref data)
	files.

2009-07-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding Jet::neutralEnergy() (and Jet::totalEnergy() for
	convenience/symmetry).

2009-06-25  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Tidying and small efficiency improvements in CDF_2008_S7541902
	W+jets analysis (remove unneeded second stage of jet storing,
	sorting the jets twice, using foreach, etc.).

2009-06-24  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixing Jet's containsBottom and containsCharm methods, since B
	hadrons are not necessarily to be found in the final
	state. Discovered at the same time that HepMC::GenParticle defines
	a massively unhelpful copy constructor that actually loses the
	tree information; it would be better to hide it entirely!

	* Adding RivetHepMC.hh, which defines container-type accessors to
	HepMC particles and vertices, making it possible to use Boost
	foreach and hence avoiding the usual huge boilerplate for-loops.

2009-06-11  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding --disable-pdfmanual option, to make the bootstrap a bit
	more robust.

	* Re-enabling D0IL in FastJets: adding 10^-10 to the pTmin removes
	the numerical instability!

	* Fixing CDF_2004 min/max cone analysis to use calo jets for the
	leading jet Et binning. Thanks to Markus Warsinsky
	for (re)discovering this bug: I was sure it had been fixed. I'm
	optimistic that this will fix the main distributions, although
	Swiss Cheese "minus 3" is still likely to be broken. Early tests
	look okay, but it'll take more stats before we can remove the "do
	not trust" sign.

2009-06-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Providing "calc" methods so that Thrust and Sphericity
	projections can be used as calculators without having to use the
	projecting/caching system.

2009-06-09  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* 1.1.3 release!

	* More doc building and SWIG robustness tweaks.

2009-06-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Make doc build from metadata work even before the library is
	installed.

2009-06-07  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fix phi rotation in CDF_2008_LEADINGJETS.

2009-06-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Disabling D0 IL midpoint cone (using CDF modpoint instead),
	since there seems to be a crashing bug in FastJet's
	implementation: we can't release that way, since ~no D0 analyses
	will run.

2009-06-03  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Putting SWIG-generated source files under SVN control to make
	life easier for people who we advise to check out the SVN head
	version, but who don't have a sufficiently modern copy of SWIG to

	* Adding the --disable-analyses option, for people who just want
	to use Rivet as a framework for their own analyses.

	* Enabling HepMC cross-section reading, now that HepMC 2.5.0 has
	been released.

2009-05-23  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Using gsl-config to locate libgsl

	* Fix the paths for linking such that our own libraries are found
	before any system libraries, e.g. for the case that there is an
	outdated fastjet version installed on the system while we want to
	use our own up-to-date version.

	* Change dmerge to ymerge in the e+e- analyses using JADE or
	DURHAM from fastjet. That's what it is called in fastjet-2.4 now.

2009-05-18  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding use of gsl-config in configure script.

2009-05-16  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removing argument to vetoEvent macro, since no weight
	subtraction is now needed. It's now just an annotated return, with
	built-in debug log message.

	* Adding an "open" FinalState, which is only calculated once per
	even, then used by all other FSes, avoiding the loop over
	non-status 1 particles.

2009-05-15  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removing incorrect setting of DPS x-errs in CDF_2008 jet shape
	analysis: the DPS autobooking already gets this bit right.

	* Using Jet rather than FastJet::PseudoJet where possible, as it
	means that the phi ranges match up nicely between Particle and the
	Jet object. The FastJet objects are only really needed if you want
	to do detailed things like look at split/merge scales for
	e.g. diff jet rates or "y-split" analyses.

	* Tidying and debugging CDF jet shape analyses and jet shape
	plugin... ongoing, but I think I've found at least one real bug,
	plus a lot of stuff that can be done a lot more nicely.

	* Fully removing deprecated math functions and updating affected
	analyses.

2009-05-14  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removing redundant rotation in DISKinematics... this was a
	legacy of Peter using theta rather than pi-theta in his rotation.

	* Adding convenience phi, rho, eta, theta, and perp,perp2 methods
	to the 3 and 4 vector classes.

2009-05-12  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding event auto-rotation for events with one proton... more
	complete approach?

2009-05-09  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Renaming CDF_2008_NOTE_9337 to CDF_2009_S8233977.

	* Numerous small bug fixes in ALEPH_1996_S3486095.

	* Adding data for one of the Rick-Field-style STAR UE analyses.

2009-05-08  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding rivet-mkanalysis script, to make generating new analysis
	source templates easier.

2009-05-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding null vector check to Vector3::azimuthalAngle().

	* Fixing definition of HCM/Breit frames in DISKinematics, and
	adding asserts to check that the transformation is doing what it
	should.

2009-05-05  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removing eta and Et cuts from CDF 2000 Z pT analysis, based on
	our reading of the paper, and converting most of the analysis to a
	call of the ZFinder projection.

2009-05-05  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Support non-default seed_threshold in CDF cone jet algorithms.

	* New analyses STAR_2006_S6870392 and STAR_2008_S7993412. In
	STAR_2008_S7993412 only the first distribution is filled at the
	moment. STAR_2006_S6870392 is normalised to data instead of the
	Monte Carlo cross-section, since we don't have that available in
	the HepMC stream yet.

2009-05-05  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Changing Event wrapper to copy whole GenEvents rather than
	pointers, use std units if supported in HepMC, and run a
	placeholder function for event auto-orientation.

2009-04-28  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removing inclusion of IsolationTools header by analyses that
	aren't actually using the isolation tools... which is all of
	them. Leaving the isolation tools in place for now, as there might
	still be use cases for them and there's quite a lot of code there
	that deserves a second chance to be used!

2009-04-24  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Deleting Rivet implementations of TrackJet and D0ILConeJets: the
	code from these has now been incorporated into FastJet 2.4.0.

	* Removed all mentions of the FastJet JADE patch and the HAVE_JADE
	preprocessor macro.

	* Bug fix to D0_2008_S6879055 to ensure that cuts compare to both
	electron and positron momenta (was just comparing against
	electrons, twice, probably thanks to the miracle of cut and
	paste).

	* Converting all D0 IL Cone jets to use FastJets. Involved tidying
	D0_2004 jet azimuthal decorrelation analysis and D0_2008_S6879055
	as part of migration away from using the getLorentzJets method,
	and removing the D0ILConeJets header from quite a few analyses
	that weren't using it at all.

	* Updating CDF 2001 to use FastJets in place of TrackJet, and
	adding axis labels to its plots.

	* Note that ZEUS_2001_S4815815 uses the wrong jet definition: it
	should be a cone but curently uses kT.

	* Fixing CDF_2005_S6217184 to use correct (midpoint, R=0.7) jet
	definition. That this was using a kT definition with R=1.0 was
	only made obvious when the default FastJets constructor was
	removed.

	* Removing FastJets default constructor: since there are now
	several good (IRC safe) jet definitions available, there is no
	obvious safe default and analyses should have to specify which
	they use.

	* Moving FastJets constructors into implementation file to reduce
	recompilation dependencies, and adding new plugins.

	* Ensuring that axis labels actually get written to the output
	data file.

2009-04-22  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding explicit FastJet CDF jet alg overlap_threshold
	constructor param values, since the default value from 2.3.x is
	now removed in version 2.4.0.

	* Removing use of HepMC ThreeVector::mag method (in one place
	only) since this has been removed in version 2.5.0b.

	* Fix to hepmc.i (included by rivet.i) to ignore new HepMC 2.5.0b
	GenEvent stream operator.

2009-04-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Dependency on FastJet now requires version 2.4.0 or later. Jade
	algorithm is now native.

	* Moving all analysis constructors and Projection headers from the
	analysis header files into their .cc implementation files, cutting
	header dependencies.

	* Removing AIDA headers: now using LWH headers only, with
	enhancement to use axis labels. This facility is now used by the
	histo booking routines, and calling the booking function versions
	which don't specify axis labels will result in a runtime warning.

2009-04-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding $(DESTDIR) prefix to call to Python module "setup.py
	install"

	* Moving HepMC SWIG mappings into Python Rivet module for now:
	seems to work-around the SL type-mapping bug.

2009-04-03  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding MC analysis for LHC UE: higher-pT replica of Tevatron
	2008 leading jets study.

	* Adding CDF_1990 pseudorapidity analysis.

	* Moving CDF_2001 constructor into implementation file.

	* Cleaning up CDF_2008_LEADINGJETS a bit, e.g. using foreach
	loops.

	* Adding function interface for specifying axis labels in histo
	bookings. Currently has no effect, since AIDA doesn't seem to have
	a mechanism for axis labels. It really is a piece of crap.

2009-03-18  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding docs "make upload" and other tweaks to make the doc files
	fit in with the Rivet website.

	* Improving LaTex docs to show email addresses in printable form
	and to group analyses by collider or other metadata.

	* Adding doc script to include run info in LaTeX docs, and to make
	HTML docs.

	* Removing WZandh projection, which wasn't generator independent
	and whose sole usage was already replaced by ZFinder.

	* Improvements to constructors of ZFinder and InvMassFS.

	* Changing ExampleTree to use real FS-based Z finding.

2009-03-16  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Allow the -H histo file spec to give a full name if wanted. If
	it doesn't end in the desired extension, it will be added.

	* Adding --runname option (and API elements) to choose a run name
	to be prepended as a "top level directory" in histo paths. An
	empty value results in no extra TLD.

2009-03-06  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding R=0.2 photon clustering to the electrons in the CDF 2000
	Z pT analysis.

2009-03-04  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixing use of fastjet-config to not use the user's PATH
	variable.

	* Fixing SWIG type table for HepMC object interchange.

2009-02-20  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding use of new metadata in command line analysis querying
	with the rivet command, and in building the PDF Rivet manual.

	* Adding extended metadata methods to the Analysis interface and
	the Python wrapper. All standard analyses comply with this new
	interface.

2009-02-19  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding usefully-scoped config headers, a Rivet::version()
	function which uses them, and installing the generated headers to
	fix "external" builds against an installed copy of Rivet. The
	version() function has been added to the Python wrapper.

2009-02-05  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removing ROOT dependency and linking. Woo! There's no need for
	this now, because the front-end accepts no histo format switch and
	we'll just use aida2root for output conversions. Simpler this way,
	and it avoids about half of our compilation bug reports from 32/64
	bit ROOT build confusions.

2009-02-04  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding automatic generation of LaTeX manual entries for the
	standard analyses.

2009-01-20  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removing RivetGun and TCLAP source files!

2009-01-19  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added psyco Python optimiser to rivet, make-plots and
	compare-histos.

	* bin/aida2root: Added "-" -> "_" mangling, following requests.

2009-01-17  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* 1.1.2 release.

2009-01-15  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Converting Python build system to bundle SWIG output in tarball.

2009-01-14  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Converting AIDA/LWH divide function to return a DPS so that bin
	width factors don't get all screwed up. Analyses adapted to use
	the new division operation (a DPS/DPS divide would also be
	nice... but can wait for YODA).

2009-01-06  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* bin/make-plots: Added --png option for making PNG output files,
	using 'convert' (after making a PDF --- it's a bit messy)

	* bin/make-plots: Added --eps option for output filtering through
	ps2eps.

2009-01-05  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Python: reworking Python extension build to use distutils and
	newer m4 Python macros. Probably breaks distcheck but is otherwise
	more robust and platform independent (i.e. it should now work on
	Macs).

2008-12-19  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* make-plots: Multi-threaded make-plots and cleaned up the LaTeX
	building a bit (necessary to remove the implicit single global
	state).

2008-12-18  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* make-plots: Made LaTeX run in no-stop mode.

	* compare-histos: Updated to use a nicer labelling syntax on the
	command line and to successfully build MC-MC plots.

2008-12-16  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Made LWH bin edge comparisons safe against numerical errors.

	* Added Particle comparison functions for sorting.

	* Removing most bad things from ExampleTree and tidying up. Marked
	WZandh projection for removal.

2008-12-03  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Added the two missing observables to the CDF_2008_NOTE_9337 analysis,
	i.e. track pT and sum(ET). There is a small difference between our MC
	output and the MC plots of the analysis' author, we're still waiting
	for the author's comments.

2008-12-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Overloading use of a std::set in the interface, since the
	version of SWIG on Sci Linux doesn't have a predefined mapping for
	STL sets.

2008-12-02  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fixed uemerge. The output was seriously broken by a single line
	of debug information in fillAbove(). Also changed uemerge output
	to exponential notation.

	* Unified ref and mc histos in compare-histos. Histos with one
	bin are plotted linear. Option for disabling the ratio plot.
	Several fixes for labels, legends, output directories, ...

	* Changed rivetgun's fallback directory for parameter files to
	$PREFIX/share/AGILe, since that's where the steering files now are.

	* Running aida2flat in split mode now produces make-plots compatible
	dat-files for direct plotting.

2008-11-28  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Replaced binreloc with an upgraded and symbol-independent copy.

2008-11-25  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added searching of $RIVET_REF_PATH for AIDA reference data
	files.

2008-11-24  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removing "get"s and other obsfucated syntax from
	ProjectionApplier (Projection and Analysis) interfaces.

2008-11-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Using new "global" Jet and V4 sorting functors in
	TrackJet. Looks like there was a sorting direction problem before...

	* Verbose mode with --list-analyses now shows descriptions as well
	as analysis names.

	* Moved data/Rivet to data/refdata and moved data/RivetGun
	contents to AGILe (since generator steering is no longer a Rivet
	thing)

	* Added unchecked ratio plots to D0 Run II jet + photon analysis.

	* Added D0 inclusive photon analysis.

	* Added D0 Z rapidity analysis.

	* Tidied up constructor interface and projection chain
	implementation of InvMassFinalState.

	* Added ~complete set of Jet and FourMomentum sorting functors.

2008-11-20  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added IdentifiedFinalState.

	* Moved a lot of TrackJet and Jet code into .cc files.

	* Fixed a caching bug in Jet: cache flag resets should never be
	conditional, since they are then sensitive to initialisation
	errors.

	* Added quark enum values to ParticleName.

	* Rationalised JetAlg interfaces somewhat, with "size()" and
	"jets()" methods in the interface.

	* Added D0 W charge asymmetry and D0 inclusive jets analyses.

2008-11-18  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding D0 inclusive Z pT shape analysis.

	* Added D0 Z + jet pT and photon + jet pT spectrum analyses.

	* Lots of tidying up of particle, event, particle name etc.

	* Now the first event is used to detect the beam type and remove
	incompatible analyses.

2008-11-17  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added bash completion for rivetgun.

	* Starting to provide stand-alone call methods on projections so
	they can be used without the caching infrastructure. This could
	also be handy for unit testing.

	* Adding functionality (sorting function and built-in sorting
	schemes) to the JetAlg interface.

2008-11-10  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fix floating point number output format in aida2flat and flat2aida

	* Added CDF_2002_S4796047: CDF Run-I charged multiplicity distribution

	* Renamed CDF_2008_MINBIAS to CDF_2008_NOTE_9337, since the
	note is publicly available now.

2008-11-10  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Added DELPHI_2003_WUD_03_11: Delphi 4-jet angular distributions.
	There is still a problem with the analysis, so don't use it yet.
	But I need to commit the code because my laptop is broken ...

2008-11-06  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Code review: lots of tidying up of projections and analyses.

	* Fixes for compatibility with the LLVM C & C++ compiler.

	* Change of Particle interface to remove "get"-prefixed method
	names.

2008-11-05  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding ability to query analysis metadata from the command line.

	* Example of a plugin analyis now in plugindemo, with a make check
	test to make sure that the plugin analysis is recognised by the
	command line "rivet" tool.

	* GCC 4.3 fix to mat-vec tests.

2008-11-04  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding native logger control from Python interface.

2008-11-03  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding bash_completion for rivet executable.

2008-10-31  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Clean-up of histo titles and analysis code review.

	* Added momentum construction functions from FastJet PseudoJets.

2008-10-28  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Auto-booking of histograms with a name, rather than the HepData
	ID 3-tuple is now possible.

	* Fix in CDF 2001 pT spectra to get the normalisations to depend
	on the pT_lead cutoff.

2008-10-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* rivet handles signals neatly, as for rivetgun, so that premature
	killing of the analysis process will still result in an analysis
	file.

	* rivet now accepts cross-section as a command line argument and,
	if it is missing and is required, will prompt the user for it
	interactively.

2008-10-22  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* rivet (Python interface) now can list analyses, check when
	adding analyses that the given names are valid, specify histo file
	name, and provide sensibly graded event number logging.

2008-10-20  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Corrections to CDF 2004 analysis based on correspondance with
	Joey Huston. M bias dbns now use whole event within |eta| < 0.7,
	and Cheese plots aren't filled at all if there are insufficient
	jets (and the correct ETlead is used).

2008-10-08  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added AnalysisHandler::commitData() method, to allow the Python
	interface to write out a histo file without having to know
	anything about the histogramming API.

	* Reduced SWIG interface file to just map a subset of Analysis and
	AnalysisHandler functionality. This will be the basis for a new
	command line interface.

2008-10-06  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Converted FastJets plugin to use a Boost shared_pointer to the
	cached ClusterSequence. The nullness of the pointer is now used to
	indicate an empty tracks (and hence jets) set. Once FastJet
	natively support empty CSeqs, we can rewrite this a bit more
	neatly and ditch the shared_ptr.

2008-10-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* The CDF_2004 (Acosta) data file now includes the full range of
	pT for the min bias data at both 630 and 1800 GeV. Previously,
	only the small low-pT insert plot had been entered into HepData.

2008-09-30  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Lots of updates to CDF_2004 (Acosta) UE analysis, including
	sorting jets by E rather than Et, and factorising transverse cone
	code into a function so that it can be called with a random
	"leading jet" in min bias mode. Min bias histos are now being
	trial-filled just with tracks in the transverse cones, since the
	paper is very unclear on this.

	* Discovered a serious caching problem in FastJets projection when
	an empty tracks vector is passed from the
	FinalState. Unfortunately, FastJet provides no API way to solve
	the problem, so we'll have to report this upstream. For now, we're
	solving this for CDF_2004 by explicitly vetoing events with no
	tracks.

	* Added Doxygen to the build with target "dox"

	* Moved detection of whether cross-section information is needed
	into the AnalysisHandler, with dynamic computation by scanning
	contained analyses.

	* Improved robustness of event reading to detect properly when the
	input file is smaller than expected.

2008-09-29  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* New analysis: CDF_2000_S4155203

2008-09-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* rivetgun can now be built and run without AGILe. Based on a
	patch by Frank Siegert.

2008-09-23  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Some preliminary numbers for the CDF_2008_LEADINGJETS analysis
	(only transverse region and not all observables. But all we have now.)

2008-09-17  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Breaking up the mammoth "generate" function, to make Python
	mapping easier, among other reasons.

	* Added if-zero-return-zero checking to angle mapping functions,
	to avoid problems where 1e-19 gets mapped on to 2 pi and then
	fails boundary asserts.

	* Added HistoHandler singleton class, which will be a central
	repository for holding analyses' histogram objects to be accessed
	via a user-chosen name.

2008-08-26  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Allowing rivet-config to return combined flags.

2008-08-14  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed some g++ 4.3 compilation bugs, including "vector" not
	being a valid name for a method which returns a physics vector,
	since it clashes with std::vector (which we globally import). Took
	the opportunity to rationalise the Jet interface a bit, since
	"particle" was used to mean "FourMomentum", and "Particle" types
	required a call to "getFullParticle". I removed the "gets" at the
	same time, as part of our gradual migration to a coherent naming
	policy.

2008-08-11  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Tidying of FastJets and added new data files from HepData.

2008-08-10  James Monk  <jmonk@hep.ucl.ac.uk>

	* FastJets now uses user_index property of fastjet::PseudoJet to
	reconstruct PID information in jet contents.

2008-08-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Reworking of param file and command line parsing. Tab characters
	are now handled by the parser, in a way equivalent to spaces.

2008-08-06  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added extra histos and filling to Acosta analysis - all HepData
	histos should now be filled, depending on sqrt{s}. Also trialling
	use of LaTeX math mode in titles.

2008-08-05  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* More data files for CDF analyses (2 x 2008, 1 x 1994), and moved
	the RivetGun AtlasPythia6.params file to more standard
	fpythia-atlas.params (and added to the install list).

2008-08-04  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Reduced size of available options blocks in RivetGun help text
	by removing "~" negating variants (which are hardly ever used in
	practice) and restricting beam particles to
	PROTON, ANTIPROTON,ELECTRON and POSITRON.

	* Fixed Et sorting in Acosta analysis.

2008-08-01  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added AIDA headers to the install list, since
	external (plugin-type) analyses need them to be present for
	compilation to succeed.

2008-07-29  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed missing ROOT compile flags for libRivet.

	* Added command line repetition to logging.

2008-07-29  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Included the missing numbers and three more observables
	in the CDF_2008_NOTE_9351 analysis.

2008-07-29  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed wrong flags on rivet-config

2008-07-28  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Renamed CDF_2008_DRELLYAN to CDF_2008_NOTE_9351. Updated
	numbers and cuts to the final version of this CDF note.

2008-07-28  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectation.org>

	* Fixed polar angle calcuation to use atan2.

	* Added "mk" prefixes and x/setX convention to math classes.

2008-07-28  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Fixed definition of FourMomentum::pT (it had been returning pT2)

2008-07-27  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added better tests for Boost headers.

	* Added testing for -ansi, -pedantic and -Wall compiler flags.

2008-07-25  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* updated DELPHI_2002_069_CONF_603 according to information
	from the author

2008-07-17  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Improvements to aida2flat: now can produce one output file per
	histo, and there is a -g "gnuplot mode" which comments out the
	YODA/make_plot headers to make the format readable by gnuplot.

	* Import boost::assign namespace contents into the Rivet namespace
	--- provides very useful intuitive collection initialising
	functions.

2008-07-15  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@dur.ac.uk>

	* Fixed missing namespace in vector/matrix testing.

	* Removed Boost headers: now a system dependency.

	* Fixed polarRadius infinite loop.

2008-07-09  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed definitions of mapAngleMPiToPi, etc. and used them to fix
	the Jet::getPhi method.

	* Trialling use of "foreach" loop in CDF_2004: it works! Very nice.

2008-07-08  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removed accidental reference to an "FS" projection in
	FinalStateHCM's compare method. rivetgun -A now works again.

	* Added TASSO, SLD and D0_2008 reference data. The TASSO and SLD
	papers aren't installed or included in the tarball since there are
	currently no plans to implement these analyses.

	* Added Rivet namespacing to vector, matrix etc. classes. This
	required some re-writing and the opportunity was taken to move
	some canonical function definitions inside the classes and to
	improve the header structure of the Math area.

2008-07-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added Rivet namespace to Units.hh and Constants.hh.

	* Added Doxygen "@brief" flags to analyses.

	* Added "RIVET_" namespacing to all header guards.

	* Merged Giulio Lenzi's isolation/vetoing/invmass projections and
	D0 2008 analysis.

2008-06-23  Jon Butterworth  <J.Butterworth@ucl.ac.uk>

	* Modified FastJet to fix ysplit and split and filter.

	* Modified ExampleTree to show how to call them.

2008-06-19  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Added first version of the CDF_2008_DRELLYAN analysis described on
	http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/physics/new/qcd/abstracts/UEinDY_08.html
	There is a small difference between the analysis and this
	implementation, but it's too small to be visible.
	The fpythia-cdfdrellyan.params parameter file is for this analysis.

	* Added first version of the CDF_2008_MINBIAS analysis described on
	http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/physics/new/qcd/abstracts/minbias_08.html
	The .aida file is read from the plots on the web and will change.
	I'm still discussing some open questions about the analysis with
	the author.

2008-06-18  Jon Butterworth  <J.Butterworth@ucl.ac.uk>

	* Added First versions of splitJet and filterJet methods to
	fastjet.cc. Not yet tested, buyer beware.

2008-06-18  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added extra sorted Jets and Pseudojets methods to FastJets, and
	added ptmin argument to the JetAlg getJets() method, requiring a
	change to TrackJet.

2008-06-13  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed processing of "RG" parameters to ensure that invalid
	iterators are never used.

2008-06-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Updated AIDA reference files, changing "/HepData" root path to
	"/REF". Still missing a couple of reference files due to upstream
	problems with the HepData records.

2008-06-09  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* rivetgun now handles termination signals (SIGTERM, SIGINT and
	SIGHUP) gracefully, finishing the event loop and finalising
	histograms. This means that histograms will always get written
	out, even if not all the requested events have been generated.

2008-06-04  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Added DELPHI_2002_069_CONF_603 analysis

2008-05-30  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Added InitialQuarks projection
	* Added OPAL_1998_S3780481 analysis

2008-05-29  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* distcheck compatibility fixes and autotools tweaks.

2008-05-28  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Converted FastJet to use Boost smart_ptr for its plugin
	handling, to solve double-delete errors stemming from the heap
	cloning of projections.

	* Added (a subset of) Boost headers, particularly the smart
	pointers.

2008-05-24  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added autopackage spec files.

	* Merged these changes into the trunk.

	* Added a registerClonedProjection(...) method to
	ProjectionHandler: this is needed so that cloned projections will
	have valid pointer entries in the ProjectHandler repository.

	* Added clone() methods to all projections (need to use this,
	since the templated "new PROJ(proj)" approach to cloning can't
	handle object polymorphism.

2008-05-19  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Moved projection-applying functions into ProjectionApplier base
	class (from which Projection and Analysis both derive).

	* Added Rivet-specific exceptions in place of std::runtime_error.

	* Removed unused HepML reference files.

	* Added error handling for requested analyses with wrong case
	convention / missing name.

2008-05-15  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* New analysis PDG_Hadron_Multiplicities

	* flat2aida converter

2008-05-15  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removed unused mysterious Perl scripts!

	* Added RivetGun.HepMC logging of HepMC event details.

2008-05-14  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* New analysis DELPHI_1995_S3137023. This analysis contains
	the xp spectra of Xi+- and Sigma(1385)+-.

2008-05-13  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Improved logging interface: log levels are now integers (for
	cross-library compatibility and level setting also applies to
	existing loggers.

2008-05-09  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Improvements to robustness of ROOT checks.

	* Added --version flag on config scripts and rivetgun.

2008-05-06  Hendrik Hoeth <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* New UnstableFinalState projection which selects all hadrons,
	leptons and real photons including unstable particles.

	* In the DELPHI_1996_S3430090 analysis the multiplicities for
	pi+/pi- and p0 are filled, using the UnstableFinalState projection.

2008-05-06  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* FastJets projection now protects against the case where no
	particles exist in the final state (where FastJet throws an
	exception).

	* AIDA file writing is now separated from the
	AnalysisHandler::finalize method... API users can choose what to
	do with the histo objects, be that writing out or further
	processing.

2008-04-29  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Increased default tolerances in floating point comparisons as
	they were overly stringent and valid f.p. precision errors were
	being treated as significant.

	* Implemented remainder of Acosta UE analysis.

	* Added proper getEtSum() to Jet.

	* Added Et2() member and function to FourMomentum.

	* Added aida2flat conversion script.

	* Fixed ambiguity in TrackJet algorithm as to how the iteration
	continues when tracks are merged into jets in the inner loop.

2008-04-28  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Merged in major "ProjectionHandler" branch. Projections are now
	all stored centrally in the singleton ProjectionHandler container,
	rather than as member pointers in projections and analyses. This
	also affects the applyProjection mechanism, which is now available
	as a templated method on Analysis and Projection. Still a few
	wrinkles need to be worked out.

	* The branch changes required a comprehensive review of all
	existing projections and analyses: lots of tidying up of these
	classes, as well as the auxiliary code like math utils, has taken
	place. Too much to list and track, unfortunately!

2008-03-28  Andy Buckley  <buckley@pc54.hep.ucl.ac.uk>

	* Started second CDF UE analysis ("Acosta"): histograms defined.

	* Fixed anomalous factor of 2 in LWH conversion from Profile1D
	to DataPointSet.

	* Added pT distribution histos to CDF 2001 UE analysis.

2008-03-26  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removed charged+neutral versions of histograms and projections
	from DELPHI analysis since they just duplicate the more robust
	charged-only measurements and aren't really of interest for
	tuning.

2008-03-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Profile histograms now use error computation with proper
	weighting, as described here:
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_average

2008-02-28  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added --enable-jade flag for Professor studies with patched
	FastJet.

	* Minor fixes to LCG tag generator and gfilt m4 macros.

	* Fixed projection slicing issues with Field UE analysis.

	* Added Analysis::vetoEvent(e) function, which keeps track of the
	correction to the sum of weights due to event vetoing in analysis
	classes.

2008-02-26  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Vector<N> and derived classes now initialise to have zeroed
	components when the no-arg constructor is used.

	* Added Analysis::scale() function to scale 1D
	histograms. Analysis::normalize() uses it internally, and the
	DELPHI (A)EEC, whose histo weights are not pure event weights, and
	normalised using scale(h, 1/sumEventWeights).

2008-02-21  Hendrik Hoeth  <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Added EEC and AEEC to the DELPHI_1996_S3430090 analysis. The
	normalisation of these histograms is still broken (ticket #163).

2008-02-19  Hendrik Hoeth  <hendrik.hoeth@cern.ch>

	* Many fixes to the DELPHI_1996_S3430090 analysis: bugfix in the
	calulation of eigenvalues/eigenvectors in MatrixDiag.hh for the
	sphericity, rewrite of Thrust/Major/Minor, fixed scaled momentum,
	hemisphere masses, normalisation in single particle events,
	final state slicing problems in the projections for Thrust,
	Sphericity and Hemispheres.

2008-02-08  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Applied fixes and extensions to DIS classes, based on
	submissions by Dan Traynor.

2008-02-06  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Made projection pointers used for cut combining into const
	pointers. Required some redefinition of the Projection* comparison
	operator.

	* Temporarily added FinalState member to ChargedFinalState to stop
	projection lifetime crash.

2008-02-01  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed another misplaced factor of bin width in the
	Analysis::normalize() method.

2008-01-30  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed the conversion of IHistogram1D to DPS, both via the
	explicit Analysis::normalize() method and the implicit
	AnalysisHandler::treeNormalize() route. The root of the problem is
	the AIDA choice of the word "height" to represent the sum of
	weights in a bin: i.e. the bin width is not taken into account
	either in computing bin height or error.

2008-01-22  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Beam projection now uses HepMC GenEvent::beam_particles() method
	to get the beam particles. This is more portable and robust for
	C++ generators, and equivalent to the existing "first two" method
	for Fortran generators.

2008-01-17  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added angle range fix to pseudorapidity function (thanks to
	Piergiulio Lenzi).

2008-01-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Changed autobooking plot codes to use zero-padding (gets the
	order right in JAS, file browser, ROOT etc.). Also changed the
	'ds' part to 'd' for consistency. HepData's AIDA output has been
	correspondingly updated, as have the bundled data files.

2008-01-04  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Tidied up JetShape projection a bit, including making the
	constructor params const references. This seems to have sorted the
	runtime segfault in the CDF_2005 analysis.

	* Added caching of the analysis bin edges from the AIDA file -
	each analysis object will now only read its reference file once,
	which massively speeds up the rivetgun startup time for analyses
	with large numbhers of autobooked histos (e.g. the
	DELPHI_1996_S3430090 analysis).

2008-01-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* CDF_2001_S4751469 now uses the LossyFinalState projection, with
	an 8% loss rate.

	* Added LossyFinalState and HadronicFinalState, and fixed a
	"polarity" bug in the charged final state projection (it was
	keeping only the *uncharged* particles).

	* Now using isatty(1) to determine whether or not color escapes
	can be used. Also removed --color argument, since it can't have an
	effect (TCLAP doesn't do position-based flag toggling).

	* Made Python extension build optional (and disabled by default).

2008-01-01  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removed some unwanted DEBUG statements, and lowered the level of
	some infrastructure DEBUGs to TRACE level.

	* Added bash color escapes to the logger system.

2007-12-21  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* include/LWH/ManagedObject.h: Fixed infinite loop in
	encodeForXML cf. ticket #135.

2007-12-20  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removed HepPID, HepPDT and Boost dependencies.

	* Fixed XML entity encoding in LWH. Updated CDF_2007_S7057202
	analysis to not do its own XML encoding of titles.

2007-12-19  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Changed units header to set GeV = 1 (HepMC convention) and using
	units in CDF UE analysis.

2007-12-15  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Introduced analysis metadata methods for all analyses (and made
	them part of the Analysis interface).

2007-12-11  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added JetAlg base projection for TrackJet, FastJet etc.

2007-12-06  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added checking for Boost library, and the standard Boost test
	program for shared_ptr.

	* Got basic Python interface running - required some tweaking
	since Python and Rivet's uses of dlopen collide (another
	RTLD_GLOBAL issue - see
	http://muttley.hates-software.com/2006/01/25/c37456e6.html )

2007-12-05  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Replaced all use of KtJets projection with FastJets
	projection. KtJets projection disabled but left undeleted for
	now. CLHEP and KtJet libraries removed from configure searches and
	Makefile flags.

2007-12-04  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Param file loading now falls back to the share/RivetGun
	directory if a local file can't be found and the provided name has
	no directory separators in it.

	* Converted TrackJet projection to update the jet centroid with
	each particle added, using pT weighting in the eta and phi
	averaging.

2007-12-03  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Merged all command line handling functions into one large parse
	function, since only one executable now needs them. This removes a
	few awkward memory leaks.

	* Removed rivet executable - HepMC file reading functionality will
	move into rivetgun.

	* Now using HepMC IO_GenEvent format (IO_Ascii and
	IO_ExtendedAscii are deprecated). Now requires HepMC >= 2.3.0.

	* Added forward declarations of GSL diagonalisation routines,
	eliminating need for GSL headers to be installed on build machine.

2007-11-27  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removed charge differentiation from Multiplicity projection (use
	CFS proj) and updated ExampleAnalysis to produce more useful numbers.

	* Introduced binreloc for runtime path determination.

	* Fixed several bugs in FinalState, ChargedFinalState, TrackJet
	and Field analysis.

	* Completed move to new analysis naming scheme.

2007-11-26  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removed conditional HAVE_FASTJET bits: FastJet is now compulsory.

	* Merging appropriate RivetGun parts into Rivet. RivetGun currently broken.

2007-11-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Renaming analyses to Spires-ID scheme: currently of form
	S<SpiresID>, to become <Expt>_<YYYY>_<SpiresID>.

2007-11-20  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Merged replacement vectors, matrices and boosts into trunk.

2007-11-15  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* src/Analysis.cc, include/Rivet/Analysis.hh: Introduced normalize
	function. See ticket #126.

2007-10-31  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

 	* Tagging as 1.0b2 for HERA-LHC meeting.


2007-10-25  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added AxesDefinition base interface to Sphericity and Thrust,
	used by Hemispheres.

	* Exposed BinaryCut class, improved its interface and fixed a few
	bugs. It's now used by VetoedFinalState for momentum cuts.

	* Removed extra output from autobooking AIDA reader.

	* Added automatic DPS booking.

2007-10-12  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Improved a few features of the build system

2007-10-09  James Monk

	* Fixed dylib dlopen on Mac OS X.

2007-10-05  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added new reference files.


2007-10-03  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed bug in configure.ac which led to explicit CXX setting
	being ignored.

	* Including Logging.hh in Projection.hh, hence new transitive
	dependency on Logging.hh being installed. Since this is the normal
	behaviour, I don't think this is a problem.

	* Fixed segfaulting bug due to use of addProjection() in
	locally-scoped contained projections. This isn't a proper fix,
	since the whole framework should be designed to avoid the
	possibility of bugs like this.

	* Added newly built HepML and AIDA reference files for current
	analyses.

2007-10-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed possible null-pointer dereference in Particle copy
	constructor and copy assignment: this removes one of two blocker
	segfaults, the other of which is related to the copy-assignment of
	the TotalVisMomentum projection in the ExampleTree analysis.

2007-10-01  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed portable path to Rivet share directory.

2007-09-28  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added more functionality to the rivet-config script: now has
	libdir, includedir, cppflags, ldflags and ldlibs options.

2007-09-26  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added the analysis library closer function to the
	AnalysisHandler finalize() method, and also moved the analysis
	delete loop into AnalysisHandler::finalize() so as not to try
	deleting objects whose libraries have already closed.

	* Replaced the RivetPaths.cc.in method for portable paths with
	something using -D defines - much simpler!

2007-09-21  Lars Sonnenschein  <sonne@mail.cern.ch>

	* Added HepEx0505013 analysis and JetShape projection (some fixes
	by AB.)

	* Added GetLorentzJets member function to D0 RunII cone jet projection

2007-09-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed lots if bugs and bad practice in HepEx0505013 (to make it
	compile-able!)

	* Downclassed the log messages from the Test analysis to DEBUG
	level.

	* Added isEmpty() method to final state projection.

	* Added testing for empty final state and useful debug log
	messages to sphericity projection.

2007-09-20  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added Hemispheres projection, which calculates event hemisphere
	masses and broadenings.

2007-09-19  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added an explicit copy assignment operator to Particle: the
	absence of one of these was responsible for the double-delete
	error.

	* Added a "fuzzy equals" utility function for float/double types
	to Utils.hh (which already contains a variety of handy little
	functions).

	* Removed deprecated Beam::operator().

	* Added ChargedFinalState projection and de-pointered the
	contained FinalState projection in VetoedFinalState.

2007-09-18  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Major bug fixes to the regularised version of the sphericity
	projection (and hence the Parisi tensor projection). Don't trust
	C & D param results from any previous version!

	* Added extra methods to thrust and sphericity projections to get
	the oblateness and the sphericity basis (currently returns dummy
	axes since I can't yet work out how to get the similarity
	transform eigenvectors from CLHEP)

2007-09-14  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Merged in a branch of pluggable analysis mechanisms.

2007-06-25  Jon Butterworth  <jmb@hep.ucl.ac.uk>

	* Fixed some bugs in the root output for DataPoint.h

2007-06-25  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* include/Rivet/**/Makefile.am: No longer installing headers for
	"internal" functionality.

	* include/Rivet/Projections/*.hh: Removed the private restrictions
	on copy-assignment operators.

2007-06-18  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* include/LWH/Tree.h: Fixed minor bug in listObjectNames.

	* include/LWH/DataPointSet.h: Fixed setCoordinate functions so
	that they resize the vector of DataPoints if it initially was
	empty.

	* include/LWH/DataPoint.h: Added constructor taking a vector of
	measuremts.

2007-06-16  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* include/LWH/Tree.h: Implemented the listObjectNames and ls
	functions.

	* include/Rivet/Projections/FinalStateHCM.hh,
	include/Rivet/Projections/VetoedFinalState.hh: removed
	_theParticles and corresponding access function. Use base class
	variable instead.

	* include/Rivet/Projections/FinalState.hh: Made _theParticles
	protected.

2007-06-13  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* src/Projections/FinalStateHCM.cc,
	src/Projections/DISKinematics.cc: Equality checks using
	GenParticle::operator== changed to check for pointer equality.

	* include/Rivet/Analysis/HepEx9506012.hh: Uses modified DISLepton
	projection.

	* include/Rivet/Particle.hh: Added member function to check if a
	GenParticle is associated.

	* include/Rivet/Projections/DISLepton.hh,
	src/Projections/DISLepton.cc: Fixed bug in projection. Introduced
	final state projection to limit searching for scattered
	lepton. Still not properly tested.

2007-06-08  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* include/Rivet/Projections/PVertex.hh,
	src/Projections/PVertex.cc: Fixed the projection to simply get the
	signal_process_vertex from the GenEvent. This is the way it should
	work. If the GenEvent does not have a signal_process_vertex
	properly set up in this way, the problem is with the class that
	fills the GenEvent.

2007-06-06  Jon Butterworth  <jmb@hep.ucl.ac.uk>

	* Merged TotalVisibleMomentum and CalMET
	* Added pT ranges to Vetoed final state projection

2007-05-27  Jon Butterworth  <jmb@hep.ucl.ac.uk>

	* Fixed initialization of VetoedFinalStateProjection in ExampleTree

2007-05-27  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* include/Rivet/Projections/KtJets.*: Make sure the KtEvent is
	deleted properly.

2007-05-26  Jon Butterworth  <jmb@hep.ucl.ac.uk>

	* Added leptons to the ExampleTree.
	* Added TotalVisibleEnergy projection, and added output to ExampleTree.

2007-05-25  Jon Butterworth  <jmb@hep.ucl.ac.uk>

	* Added a charged lepton projection

2007-05-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* src/Analysis/HepEx0409040.cc: Changed range of the histograms to
	the "pi" range rather than the "128" range.

	* src/Analysis/Analysis.cc: Fixed a bug in the AIDA path building.
	Histogram auto-booking now works.

2007-05-23  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* src/Analysis/HepEx9506012.cc: Now uses the histogram booking
	function in the Analysis class.

2007-05-23  Jon Butterworth  <jmb@hep.ucl.ac.uk>

	* Fixed bug in PRD65092002 (was failing on zero jets)

2007-05-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added (but haven't properly tested) a VetoedFinalState projection.

	* Added normalize() method for AIDA 1D histograms.

	* Added configure checking for Mac OS X version, and setting the
	development target flag accordingly.

2007-05-22  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added an ostream method for AnalysisName enums.

	* Converted Analyses and Projections to use projection lists, cuts
	and beam constraints.

	* Added beam pair combining to the BeamPair sets of Projections
	by finding set meta-intersections.

	* Added methods to Cuts, Analysis and Projection to make Cut
	definition easier.

	* Fixed default fall-through in cut handling switch statement and
	now using -numeric_limits<double>::max() rather than min()

	* Added more control of logging presentation via static flag
	methods on Log.

2007-05-13  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added self-consistency checking mechanisms for Cuts and Beam

	* Re-implemented the cut-handling part of RivetInfo as a Cuts class.

	* Changed names of Analysis and Projection name() and handler()
	methods to getName() and getHandler() to be more consistent with
	the rest of the public method names in those classes.

2007-05-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added auto-booking of histogram bins from AIDA XML files. The
	AIDA files are located via a C++ function which is generated from
	RivetPaths.cc.in by running configure.


2007-04-18  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added a preliminary version of the Rick Field UE analysis, under
	the name PRD65092002.

2007-04-19  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* src/Analysis/HepEx0409040.cc: The reason this did not compile
	under gcc-4 is that some iterators into a vector were wrongly
	assued to be pointers and were initialized to 0 and later compared
	to 0. I've changed this to initialize to end() of the
	corresponding vector and to compare with the same end() later.

2007-04-05  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Lots of name changes in anticipation of the MCNet
	school. RivetHandler is now AnalysisHandler (since that's what it
	does!), BeamParticle has become ParticleName, and RivetInfo has
	been split into Cut and BeamConstraint portions.

	* Added BeamConstraint mechanism, which can be used to determine
	if an analysis is compatible with the beams being used in the
	generator. The ParticleName includes an "ANY" wildcard for this
	purpose.

2006-03-19  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added "rivet" executable which can read in HepMC ASCII dump
	files and apply Rivet analyses on the events.

2007-02-24  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* src/Projections/KtJets.cc: Added comparison of member variables
	in compare() function

	* all: Merged changes from polymorphic-projections branch into
	trunk

2007-02-17  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* all: projections and analysis handlers: All projections which
	uses other projctions now has a pointer rather than a copy of
	those projections to allow for polymorphism. The constructors has
	also been changed to require the used projections themselves,
	rather than the arguments needed to construct them.

2007-02-17  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* src/Projections/FinalState.cc,
	include/Rivet/Projections/FinalState.icc (Rivet),
	include/Rivet/Projections/FinalState.hh: Added cut in transverse
	momentum on the particles to be included in the final state.

2007-02-06  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* include/LWH/HistogramFactory.h: Fixed divide-by-zero in divide
	function. Also fixed bug in error calculation in divide
	function. Introduced checkBin function to make sure two histograms
	are equal even if they have variable bin widths.

	* include/LWH/Histogram1D.h: In normalize(double), do not do anything
	if the sum of the bins are zero to avoid dividing by zero.

2007-01-20  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* src/Test/testLWH.cc: Modified to output files using the Tree.

	* configure.ac: Removed AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([include/Rivet/Config])
	since the directory does not exist anymore.

2006-12-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Rivet will now conditionally install the AIDA and LWH headers if
	it can't find them when configure'ing.

	* Started integrating Leif's LWH package to fulfill the AIDA
	duties.

	* Replaced multitude of CLHEP wrapper headers with a single
	RivetCLHEP.h header.

2006-11-20  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Introduced log4cpp logging.

	* Added analysis enum, which can be used as input to an analysis
	factory by Rivet users.

2006-11-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Yet more, almost pointless, administrative moving around of
	things with the intention of making the structure a bit
	better-defined:

	* The RivetInfo and RivetHandler classes have been
	moved from src/Analysis into src as they are really the main Rivet
	interface classes. The Rivet.h header has also been moved into the
	"header root".

	* The build of a single shared library in lib has been disabled,
	with the library being built instead in src.

2006-10-14  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Introduced a minimal subset of the Sherpa math tools, such as
	Vector{3,4}D, Matrix, etc. The intention is to eventually cut the
	dependency on CLHEP.

2006-07-28  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Moving things around: all sources now in directories under src

2006-06-04  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Analysis/Examples/HZ95108.*: Now uses CentralEtHCM. Also set GeV
	units on the relevant histograms.

	* Projections/CentralEtHCM.*: Making a special class just to get
	out one number - the summed Et in the central rapidity bin - may
	seem like an overkill. But in case some one else might nees it...

2006-06-03  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Analysis/Examples/HZ95108.*: Added the hz95108 energy flow
	analysis from HZtool.

	* Projections/DISLepton.*: Since many HERA measurements do not
	care if we have electron or positron beam, it is now possible to
	specify lepton or anti-lepton.

	* Projections/Event.*: Added member and access function for the
	weight of an event (taken from the GenEvent object.weights()[0].

	* Analysis/RivetHandler.*: Now depends explicitly on the AIDA
	interface. An AIDA analysis factory must be specified in the
	constructor, where a tree and histogram factory is automatically
	created. Added access functions to the relevant AIDA objects.

	* Analysis/AnalysisBase.*: Added access to the RivetHandler and
	its AIDA factories.

2005-12-27  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* configure.ac: Added -I$THEPEGPATH/include to AM_CPPFLAGS.

	* Config/Rivet.h: Added some std incudes and using std::
	declaration.

	* Analysis/RivetInfo.*: Fixed some bugs. The RivetInfo facility
	now works, although it has not been thoroughly tested.

	* Analysis/Examples/TestMultiplicity.*: Re-introduced
	FinalStateHCM for testing purposes but commented it away again.

	* .: Made a number of changes to implement handling of RivetInfo
	objects.
