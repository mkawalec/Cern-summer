Description:
  This analysis is a demonstration of how Rivet can be used to produce
  ROOT data trees rather than Rivet's own histograms. We don't recommend
  this, since analyses written this way will not be accepted for
  inclusion into the Rivet library and hence will not contribute to
  standard MC validation and tuning studies. However, it may be useful
  for nascent private MC analyses if you are a ROOT fan.  Note that this
  example analysis does some things such as accessing parton level
  information, which are unphysical and also may be generator dependent.
  You should not use this method in your own analyses if you expect the
  results to be meaningfully comparable to data!
