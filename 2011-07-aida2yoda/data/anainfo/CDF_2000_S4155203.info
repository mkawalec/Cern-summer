RunInfo:
  $p\bar{p}$ collisions at 1800 GeV.
  $Z/\gamma^*$ Drell-Yan events with $e^+e^-$ decay mode only.
  Restrict $Z/\gamma^*$ mass range to roughly $50~\text{GeV}/c^2 < m_{ee}
    < 120~\text{GeV}/c^2$ for efficiency.

Description:
  Measurement of transverse momentum and total cross section of $e^+e^-$
  pairs in the Z-boson region of $66~\text{GeV}/c^2 < m_{ee} <
  116~\text{GeV}/c^2$ from pbar-p collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.8 TeV, with
  the Tevatron CDF detector.  The Z pT, in a fully-factorised picture,
  is generated by the momentum balance against initial state radiation
  (ISR) and the primordial/intrinsic pT of the Z's parent partons in the
  incoming hadrons. The Z pT is important in generator tuning to fix the
  interplay of ISR and multi-parton interactions (MPI) ingenerating
  `underlying event' activity.

  This analysis is subject to ambiguities in the experimental Z pT
  definition, since the Rivet implementation reconstructs the Z momentum from the
  dilepton pair with finite cones for QED bremstrahlung summation, rather than
  non-portable direct use of the (sometimes absent) Z in the event record.
