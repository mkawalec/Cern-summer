Description:
  The first measurements with the ATLAS detector at the LHC.
  Data were collected using a minimum-bias trigger in December 2009 during
  proton-proton collisions at a centre of mass energy of 900 GeV. The charged-
  particle density, its dependence on transverse momentum and pseudorapid-
  ity, and the relationship between transverse momentum and charged-particle
  multiplicity are measured for events with at least one charged particle in
  the kinematic range $|\eta| < 2.5$ and $p_\perp > 500$ MeV.
  All data is corrected to the particle level.
