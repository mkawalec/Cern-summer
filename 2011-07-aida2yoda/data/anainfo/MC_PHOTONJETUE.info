Name: MC_PHOTONJETUE
Summary: Study the usual underlying event observables in photon + jet events
Description: 
  Modification of the MC leading jets underlying event analysis to study the UE in
  hard photon+jet events. This may be of interest, because the leading QCD dipole
  structure is different from that in either dijet or Drell-Yan hard
  processes. Observables are also extended to include the variation of transverse
  activity as a function of jet-photon balance, and using the photon rather than
  the jet to define the event alignment.
RunInfo: Photon + jet events at any energy. pT cutoff at 10 GeV advised.
