RunInfo:
  All processes that can produce prompt photon pairs, e.g. $jj \to jj$,
  $jj \to j\gamma$ and $jj \to \gamma \gamma$.
  Non-prompt photons from hadron decays like $\pi$ and $\eta$ have been
  corrected for.

Description:
  Direct photon pair production cross sections are measured using 4.2 fb$^{-1}$
  of data. They are binned in diphoton mass, the transverse momentum of the
  diphoton system, the azimuthal angle between the photons, and the polar
  scattering angle of the photons. Also available are double differential cross
  sections considering the last three kinematic variables in three diphoton
  mass bins.
  Note, the numbers in version 1 of the arXiv preprint were missing the dM
  normalisation in the double differential cross sections. This has been
  reported to and fixed by the authors in v2 and the journal submission.
  HepData as well as the Rivet analysis have also been updated.
