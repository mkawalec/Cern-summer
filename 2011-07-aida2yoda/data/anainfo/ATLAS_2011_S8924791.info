  pp QCD interactions at 7TeV GeV, corresponding to JX samples. Matching plots to
  kinematic pT cut samples, or merging from slices or pT-enhanced sampling is advised.

Description:
  Measurement of jet shapes in inclusive jet production in pp collisions at 7 TeV
  based on 3pb$^-1$ of data. Jets are reconstructed in $|\eta| < 5$ using the
  anti-$k_\perp$ algorithm with $30 < pT < 600$ GeV and $|y| < 2.8$.
