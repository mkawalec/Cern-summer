Description:
  Earlier measurements at LEP of isolated hard photons in hadronic Z decays,
  attributed to radiation from primary quark pairs, have been extended in the
  ALEPH experiment to include hard photon production inside hadron jets. Events
  are selected where all particles combine democratically to form hadron jets,
  one of which contains a photon with a fractional energy $z > 0.7$. After 
  statistical subtraction of non-prompt photons, the quark-to-photon
  fragmentation function, $D(z)$, is extracted directly from the measured 2-jet
  rate.
