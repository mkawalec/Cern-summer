Description:
  First measurements at a hadron collider of differential cross
  sections for $Z (\to \mu\mu)$+jet+X production in $\Delta\phi(Z, j)$,
  $|\Delta y(Z, j)|$ and $|y_\mathrm{boost}(Z, j)|$.
  Vector boson production in association with jets is an excellent
  probe of QCD and constitutes the main background to many small
  cross section processes, such as associated Higgs production.
  These measurements are crucial tests of the predictions of perturbative
  QCD and current event generators, which have varied success in
  describing the data.
  Using these measurements as inputs in tuning event generators will
  increase the experimental sensitivity to rare signals.
