RunInfo:
  $p \bar{p} \to e^+ e^-$ + jets at 1960~GeV.
  Needs mass cut on lepton pair to avoid photon singularity,
  looser than $75 < m_{ee} < 105$ GeV.

Description:
  Cross sections as a function of pT of the three leading jets and $n$-jet
  cross section ratios in $p \bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 1.96 TeV, based
  on an integrated luminosity of $0.4~\text{fb}^{-1}$.
