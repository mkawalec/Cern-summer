Description:
  'A measurement of the cross section for inclusive isolated photon production at $sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV.  
  The measurement covers three ranges in $|\eta|$: [0.00,0.60), [0.60,1.37), and [1.52,1.81), for 
  $E_T^\gamma>15$~GeV.  The measurement uses 880nb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected with
  the ATLAS detector.'
