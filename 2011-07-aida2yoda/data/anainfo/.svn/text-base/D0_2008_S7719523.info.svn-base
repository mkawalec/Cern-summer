RunInfo:
  "Produce only gamma + jet ($q,\\bar{q},g$) hard processes (for Pythia 6, this means MSEL=10 
  and MSUB indices 14, 29 & 115 enabled). The lowest bin edge is at 30 GeV, so a kinematic 
  pTmin cut is probably required to fill the histograms."

Description:
  The process $p \bar{p}$ -> photon + jet + X as studied by the D0 detector
  at the Fermilab Tevatron collider at center-of-mass energy sqrt(s) =
  1.96 TeV. Photons are reconstructed in the central rapidity region
  $|y_\gamma| < 1.0$ with transverse momenta in the range 30--400 GeV,
  while jets are reconstructed in either the central $|y_\text{jet}| < 0.8$ or
  forward $1.5 < |y_\text{jet}| < 2.5$ rapidity intervals with
  $pT^\text{jet} > 15~\text{GeV}$. The differential cross section
  $\mathrm{d}^3 \sigma / \mathrm{d}{pT^\gamma} \mathrm{d}{y_\gamma}
  \mathrm{d}{y_\text{jet}}$ is measured as a function of $pT^\gamma$ in four
  regions, differing by the relative orientations of the photon and the
  jet.  MC predictions have trouble with simultaneously describing the
  measured normalization and $pT^\gamma$ dependence of the cross section
  in any of the four measured regions.
