Description:
  Correlations in the azimuthal angle between the two largest pT jets
  have been measured using the D0 detector in ppbar collisions at 
  1960~GeV. The analysis is based on an inclusive dijet event sample in 
  the central rapidity region. The correlations are determined for four
  different pT intervals.
