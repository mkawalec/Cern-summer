Description:
  A measurement of the cross section for the inclusive production of isolated
  photons. The measurement covers the pseudorapidity region $|\eta^\gamma|<1.0$
  and the transverse energy range $E_T^\gamma>30$~GeV and is based on 2.5~fb$^{-1}$
  of integrated luminosity. The cross section is measured differential in
  $E_\perp(\gamma)$.
