  "* Single- and double-diffractive, plus non-diffractive inelastic, events.
  * $p\\bar{p}$ collider, sqrt(s) = 200 or 900 GeV.
  * The trigger implementation for NSD events is the same as in, e.g., 
    the UA5_1989 analysis. No further cuts are needed."

Description:
  This study comprises measurements of pseudorapidity distributions measured with the UA5
  detector at 200 and 900 GeV center of momentum energy. There are distributions for
  non-single diffractive (NSD) events and also for the combination of single- and double-diffractive
  events. The NSD distributions are further studied for certain ranges of the events charged
  multiplicity.
