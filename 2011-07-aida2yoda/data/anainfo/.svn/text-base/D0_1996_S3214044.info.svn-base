Description:
  The global topologies of inclusive three- and four-jet events produced in
  pbar p interactions are described. The three- and four-jet events are
  selected from data recorded by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron
  Collider operating at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$=1800 GeV.
  The studies also show that the topological distributions of the different
  subprocesses involving different numbers of quarks are very similar and
  reproduce the measured distributions well. The parton-shower Monte Carlo
  generators provide a less satisfactory description of the topologies of the
  three- and four-jet events.
