Description:
  Measurements from proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies
  of sqrt(s) = 0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at
  the LHC. Events were collected using a single-arm minimum-bias
  trigger. The charged-particle multiplicity, its dependence on
  transverse momentum and pseudorapidity and the relationship between
  the mean transverse momentum and charged-particle multiplicity are
  measured. Measurements in different regions of phase-space are shown,
  providing diffraction-reduced measurements as well as more inclusive
  ones. The observed distributions are corrected to well-defined
  phase-space regions, using model-independent corrections.
