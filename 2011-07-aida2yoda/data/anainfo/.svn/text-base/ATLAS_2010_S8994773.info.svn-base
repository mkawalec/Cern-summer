RunInfo:
  pp QCD interactions at 900 GeV and 7 TeV. Diffractive events should be
  included, but only influence the lowest bins. Multiple kinematic cuts
  should not be required.

Description:
  Underlying event measurements with the ATLAS detector at the LHC at
  center-of-mass energies of 900 GeV and 7 TeV, using calorimeter
  clusters rather than charged tracks.
