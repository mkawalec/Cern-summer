RunInfo:
  $p\bar{p}$ QCD interactions at 1960~GeV. Particles with 
  $c \tau > {}$10 mm should be set stable. Several $p_\perp^\text{min}$ 
  cutoffs are probably required to fill the profile histograms.
  $p_\perp^\text{min} = {}$ 0 (min bias), 10, 20, 50, 100, 150 GeV.
  The corresponding merging points are at $p_T = $ 0, 30, 50, 80, 
  130, 180 GeV

Description:
  Rick Field's measurement of the underlying event in leading jet
  events. If the leading jet of the event is within $|\eta| < 2$, the
  event is accepted and ``toward'', ``away'' and ``transverse'' regions
  are defined in the same way as in the original (2001) CDF underlying
  event analysis. The leading jet defines the $\phi$ direction of the
  toward region. The transverse regions are most sensitive to the
  underlying event.
