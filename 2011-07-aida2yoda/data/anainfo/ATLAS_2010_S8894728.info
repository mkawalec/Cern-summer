  should not be required.

Description:
  The underlying event measurements with the ATLAS detector at the LHC
  at the center of mass energies of 900 GeV and 7 TeV. The observables
  sensitive to the underlying event, i.e the charged particle density
  and charged pT sum, as well as their standard deviations and the
  average pT, are measured as functions of the leading track. A track pT
  cut of 500 MeV is applied for most observables, but the main profile
  plots are also shown for a lower track cut of 100 MeV, which includes
  much more of the soft cross-section. The angular distribution of the
  charged tracks with respect to the leading track is also studied, as
  are the correlation between mean transverse momentum and charged
  particle multiplicity, and the `plateau' height as a function of the
  leading track $|\eta|$.
