Summary: Charged particle multiplicity in ppbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.8 TeV
Experiment: E735
Collider: Tevatron
SpiresID: 3905616
Status: UNVALIDATED - need trigger etc.

RunInfo: QCD events, diffractive processes need to be switched
  on in order to fill the low multiplicity regions. The measurement was done in
  $\left|\eta\right| ~< ~3.25$ and was extrapolated to full phase space. However, the method of
  extrapolation remains unclear.
