Description:
  Measurement of differential cross section for inclusive production of
  isolated photons in p pbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV with the
  D\O detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. The photons span
  transverse momenta 23--300 GeV and have pseudorapidity $|\eta| < 0.9$.
  Isolated direct photons are probes of pQCD via the annihilation ($q
  \bar{q} -> \gamma g$) and quark-gluon Compton scattering ($q g -> \gamma q$)
  processes, the latter of which is also sensitive to the gluon PDF. The
  initial state radiation / resummation formalisms are sensitive to the
  resulting photon pT spectrum
