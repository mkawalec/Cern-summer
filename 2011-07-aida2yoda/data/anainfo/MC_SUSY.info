Name: MC_SUSY
Summary: Validate generic SUSY events, including various lepton invariant mass
Description: 
  Analysis of generic SUSY events at the LHC, based on Atlas Herwig++ 
  validation analysis contents. Plotted are eta, phi and pT observables 
  for charged tracks, photons, isolated photons, electrons, muons, and jets, 
  as well as various dilepton mass `edge' plots for different event selection 
  criteria.
RunInfo: SUSY events at any energy. pT cutoff at 10 GeV may be advised.
Status: VALIDATED
