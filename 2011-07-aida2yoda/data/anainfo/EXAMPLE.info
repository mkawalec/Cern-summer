Description:
  "This analysis is a demonstration of the Rivet analysis structure and
  functionality: booking histograms; the initialisation, analysis and
  finalisation phases; and a simple loop over event particles. It has no
  physical meaning, but can be used as a simple pedagogical template for
  writing real analyses."
