RunInfo:
  Requires the process $p\bar{p} \rightarrow {Z} \rightarrow{\ell}\ell$, where $\ell$ is $e$ or $\mu$. Additional hard jets will also have to be included to get a good description.

Description:
  Measurement of the b-jet production cross section for events
  containing a $Z$ boson produced in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at
  $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV, using data corresponding to an integrated
  luminosity of 2 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the CDF II detector at the
  Tevatron. $Z$ bosons are selected in the electron and muon decay
  modes. Jets are considered with transverse energy $E_T>20$ GeV and
  pseudorapidity $|\eta|<1.5$. The ratio of the integrated $Z$ + b-jet
  cross section to the inclusive $Z$ production cross section is
  measured differentially in jet $E_T$, jet $\eta$, $Z$-boson transverse
  momentum, number of jets, and number of b-jets. The first two
  measurements have an entry for each b-jet in the event, the last three
  measurements have one entry per event.
