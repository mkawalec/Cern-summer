Description:
  Analysis of charm quark fragmentation at 10.6 GeV, based on a data
  sample of 103 fb collected by the Belle detector at the KEKB accelerator. 
  Fragmentation into charm is studied for the main charmed hadron ground states, 
  namely $D^0$, $D^+$, $D^+_s$ and $\Lambda_c^+$, as well as the excited states 
  $D^{*0}$ and $D^{*+}$. This analysis can be used to constrain charm fragmentation 
  in Monte Carlo generators. Additionally, we determine the average number of
  these charmed hadrons produced per B decay at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance
  and measure the distribution of their production angle in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation 
  events and in B decays.
