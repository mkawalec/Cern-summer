Description:
  The first jet cross section measurement made with the ATLAS detector at the LHC.
  Jets are resconstructed within $|y|<2.8$ and above 60~GeV for the inclusive jet
  cross section plots.  For the di-jet plots the second jet must have pT>30~GeV.
  Jet pT and di-jet mass spectra are plotted in bins or rapidity $|y|<0.3$,
  $0.3<|y|<0.8$, $0.8<|y|<1.2$, $1.2<|y|<2.1$, $2.1<|y|<2.8$.  Di-jet $\chi$
  spectra are plotted in bins of di-jet mass $340~GeV<m_{12}<520~GeV$,
  $520~GeV<m_{12}<800~GeV$ and $800~GeV<m_{12}<1200~GeV$.
