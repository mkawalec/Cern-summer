Description:
  Measurement of the muon charge asymmetry from W bosons produced in
  proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with ATLAS.
  The asymmetry is measured in the $W \rightarrow \mu$ decay mode as a function
  of the muon pseudorapidity using a data sample corresponding to a total
  integrated luminosity of 31pb$^-1$.
