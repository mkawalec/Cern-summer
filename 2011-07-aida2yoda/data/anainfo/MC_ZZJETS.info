RunInfo:
  $ZZ$ + jets analysis. Needs mass cut on lepton pairs to avoid
  photon singularity, e.g. a min range of $66 < m_{ee} < 116$ GeV
NumEvents: 1000000
PtCuts: [0]
Description:
  In addition to the typical jet observables this analysis contains observables
  related to properties of the ZZ-pair momentum, correlations between the ZZ,
  properties of the Z bosons, properties of the leptons, correlations between
  the opposite charge leptons and correlations with jets.
