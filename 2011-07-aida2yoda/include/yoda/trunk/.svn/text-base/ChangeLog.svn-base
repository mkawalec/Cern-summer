2011-07-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Add construction of Histo1Ds from Profile1D and Histo1D, and
	construction of Profile1Ds from those and Scatter2D.

2011-07-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Add construction of a Histo1D from Scatter2D.

2011-06-15  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Making the AIDA reader work, including reading of annotations
	and a few tweaks to the simple type persistency system. Test histo
	1b updated.

2011-06-12  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removing Histo1D::area

	* Filling and using under/overflow and total db on Histo1D, and
	adding boolean arg to integral, sumW, etc.

	* Fixing for C++ change in behaviour of std::make_pair

	* Adding addAnnotation, and mapping annotations to Python.

2011-02-22  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Use distutils rather than setuptools for the Python interface
	build.

	* Renaming Bin, HistoBin and ProfileBin to be Bin1D, HistoBin1D,
	ProfileBin1D. Bin is now a top-level abstract class with minimal
	functionality to be shared between 1D and 2D bins.

2011-01-12  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Type annotations in mkScatter

	* Added many vector constructors and addPoint functions to
	Scatter2D.

2011-01-11  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Add lexical_cast support to annotation get and set functions.

	* Write out annotations in AIDA format, and copy annotations in
	mkScatter -- using a new AnalysisObject::setAnnotations method.

	* Convert DPS output to use interim Scatter construction

	* Make (unused) yoda.plot subpackage.

	* Write out annotations in YODA format.

	* Make Scatter2D representations of Histo1D and Profile1D.

	* Write out Scatter2D objects in AIDA and YODA formats.

	* Make Scatter2D and Point2D work. Add a few extra
	methods... evolution and tweaking required.

2011-01-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Add Boost checks and header includes. Not used yet.

	* Hide Utils:: content from Doxygen and nvector -> Utils::nvector.

	* Removing unused YAML stuff: we aren't going that way for
	persistency anymore.

	* Renaming Axis -> Axis1D

	* Removing dead-end templated Scatter stuff.

	* Move (generated) config files into the Config subdir.

	* Move sortedvector and indexedset into the Utils dir.

	* Move the "utils" directory and namespace to "Utils"

	* Put the Doxyfile under configure control by moving it to
	Doxyfile.in and using the @PACKAGE_VERSION@ token.

	* Make Doxygen find the .icc file and hide functions with name _*
	and in the YAML namespace.

	* Removing the Binning argument and enum in favour of explicit bin
	edge vectors, possibly produced explicitly via the MathUtils
	linspace and logspace functions, or the new Axis::mkBinEdgesLin/Log
	alias functions.

	* Fixed Axis, Histo1D and Profile1D constructors, by adding a path
	argument, passing the path and title args to the AnalysisObject
	base constructor properly.

	* Removed several old and unused files such as Tree.h

2011-01-09  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Updating copyright comments to be valid into 2011.

	* Persistency fixes, and changing the interface to use the annotated path.

	* Using annotations for path and title.

	* Adding tests of collection and iterator range AO writing.

	* Adding static write functions on Writer*.h implementations to
	avoid needing to make an explicit Writer object via the create()
	functions.

	* Rename Exception.h -> Exceptions.h

	* Added AnnotationError.

	* Re-enable persistency of collections with begin/end iterators.

2011-01-08  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Enabling quiet compilation.

	* More annotation functionality.

2011-01-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Sorting out autoheaders to be more useful.

	* Rewriting AIDA writer to use DPS representation (no reloading)
	for Histo1D and Profile1D objects.

	* Adding persistency system hooks, since RTTI just sucks too much.

	* Renaming test files to have more meaningful names.

2010-12-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Some tweaks to Axis, Bin, etc. to use the sortedvector. Seems to
	be working! (I must be checking it wrongly...)

	* Adding another candidate object for the axis bin container: a
	sorted extension to STL std::vector with an insert method. This
	will do as a development placeholder: a proper sorted & indexed
	container may be substituted later.

	* Fix test code: titles are no longer given as histogram
	constructor arguments.

2010-11-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding indexed set for holding bins on axes. Still not sure it's
	what we want, as (I just realised) STL sets are iterator-immutable
	because they are self-keyed and changes to elements would also
	change their sorting.

2010-09-19  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Restarting ChangeLog contributions! Many changes in the huge
	time since last update... activity on YODA has renewed and we have
	a better picture of the distinctive features we require. New idea:
	named weight vector filling, allowing "parallel" histograms for
	various event weight variations. I/O remains an awkward issue,
	especially since the classes are now much richer than they used to
	be, and don't know about paths. Output can be easily put on top:
	not an issue... and we can probably do something with
	pickling. But reading in from C++?

2008-09-16  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Moved duplicate Histo1D/Profile1D code on to Axis, making Axis a
	templated class at the same time.

2008-09-12  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Started work on a little plotting tool, initially for Herwig++
	parton pT cut testing, but incrementally enhancing it to be a
	command-line quick plotter seems like a good idea.

	* Added some more test programs... working towards a proper test
	suite.

	* Added "no path & title" constructors - you don't always want to
	write out the histo, since sometimes it's just a good way to
	gather statistics.

	* Fixed YODA mapping to allow use of vectors of bins as Python
	lists.

	* Added Profile1D functionality.

	* Fixed Dbn1D to use sign(weight) as part of the "w**2" measure,
	so that negative weights behave themselves.

2008-05-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added Dbn1D class to centralise the calculation of statistics
	from unbounded, unbinned, weighted distributions.

2008-05-15  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added Profile1D class.

	* Fixed NaN errors from zero weights.

2008-04-14  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Python SWIG interface now compiles and can be used: the subtlety
	that was breaking it was that SWIG has to be prodded in pretty
	non-obvious ways to make std::vectors of classes without
	default (no-arg) constructors. See
	http://osdir.com/ml/programming.swig/2004-04/msg00011.html for
	about the only reference to this to be found anywhere!

	* Basic AIDA writer now available - it doesn't yet output all the
	necessary information though, especially not for merging parallel
	runs.
