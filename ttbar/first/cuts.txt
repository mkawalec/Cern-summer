From the paper:
Analysis uses similar data samples as Ref 15.
lepton + jets ->
  exactly one isolated lepton (ChargedLeptons.multiplicity = 1), pT > 20GeV
  >= 4 jets with pT > 20GeV AND |eta| < 2.5
  At least one jet with pT > 40GeV
  At least one jet B tagged
  e  -> E_T > 20GeV, |eta| < 1.1
  mu -> E_T > 25GeV, |eta| < 2.0

  used a CTEQ6L1 set of PDFs with a common factorisation and renormalisation
  scale of mu = m_t + \sum p_t^{jets} for m_t = 170GeV

  detector response simulated using geant

  The fit assumes
  equal masses for the two reconstructed top quarks and
  the two reconstructed W boson masses are constrained
  to 80.4 GeV/c2 .


  The simulated tt signal is normalized to the cross section
   measured by a dedicated likelihood fit in the same fi-
   nal state using the same event selections (including the
   b-tagging requirement) and data as Ref. [15], namely to
   8.46+1.09 pb at a top-quark mass mt = 170 GeV/c2 (in
   âˆ’0.97
   good agreement with the value extracted in this study
   by integrating the differential cross section)
