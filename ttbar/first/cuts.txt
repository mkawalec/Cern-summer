From the paper:
Analysis uses similar data samples as Ref 15.
lepton + jets ->
  exactly one isolated lepton (ChargedLeptons.multiplicity = 1), pT > 20GeV
  >= 4 jets with pT > 20GeV AND |eta| < 2.5
  At least one jet with pT > 40GeV
  At least one jet B tagged
  e  -> E_T > 20GeV, |eta| < 1.1
  mu -> E_T > 25GeV, |eta| < 2.0
