Description:
  'Transverse momentum spectra and yields of pions, kaons and protons
  at mid-rapidity at the LHC, measured in proton-proton collisions at
  $\sqrt{s} = 900GeV$ with the ALICE detector. A rapidity cut of
  $|y| < 0.5$ is used. Comparison with event generators shows large
  deviations in the kaon and proton spectra.'
